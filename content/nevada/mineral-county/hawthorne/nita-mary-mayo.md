  disappearance_details: Mayo was last seen her residence in the 1100 block of Park
    Street in Hawthorne, Nevada on August 8, 2005. She had told a friend she was going
    on a one-day shopping trip over the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the western side
    of the mountain range. She said she would go over Sonora Pass on State Route 108,
    and would return by evening and report to work the next day. Mayo is believed
    to have left her home at 11:00 a.m. She did not arrive at work as planned and
    has never been heard from again. Two days after Mayo was last seen, her silver
    1997 Mercury Sable or Ford Taurus station wagon, which has a Marine sticker on
    the back window, was later found at Donnell's Vista, a lookout point on State
    Route 108 just outside Sonora. The keys were locked inside the car, which could
    also be opened with a keypad. Mayo's cellular phone, wallet and purse were also
    inside the vehicle; only her camera was missing. There was no sign of her at the
    scene. Authorities determined that Mayo's car had been at Donnell's Vista since
    the day of her disappearance. The lookout point overlooks a river canyon 1,000
    feet below. In September 2005, authorities announced they were seeking Jewel Jeanne
    Rice in connection with Mayo's disappearance. Photographs of Rice are posted with
    this case summary. She is not being called a suspect in Mayo's case, but investigators
    believe she may have valuable information. Police stated Rice's vehicle had mechanical
    problems in the Sonora area on the day Mayo disappeared, and she was going around
    asking people for help with it. On August 12, she left Sonora without the car.
    Her current whereabouts are unknown. Mayo was employed as a licensed practical
    nurse at the Mt. Grant General Hospital Clinic in Hawthorne at the time of her
    disappearance. Her loved ones stated she was physically and mentally healthy in
    August 2005 and it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Her case
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office 209-694-2900
