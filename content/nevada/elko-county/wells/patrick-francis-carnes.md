  disappearance_details: Carnes was last seen in Wells, Nevada on April 13, 2011.
    He was driving a green Subaru Forester with the Nevada license plate number 719
    SDN when the Nevada Highway Patrol stopped him for a traffic violation at 9:00
    p.m. He had been visiting relatives in Toledo, Ohio and was on his way back home
    to Reno, Nevada. When Carnes spoke to the patrolman, he indicated he was following
    a truck driver and the trucker was going to Elko, Nevada. He has never been heard
    from again and the truck driver he was supposedly following has never been identified.
    Just before 6:00 a.m. the next day, Carnes's vehicle was found abandoned in a
    rural area at the 205 Pumpernickel Valley exit ramp off Interstate 80 near Winnemucca,
    Nevada. There was no sign of him at the scene and his cherished pet dog, an eight-year-old
    male named Lucky, is also missing. Lucky is a brown Akita/mixed breed was slightly
    overweight at the time; he weighed about 80 to 100 pounds. A photo of the dog
    is posted with this case summary. Carnes rarely went anywhere without him. Carnes's
    truck had gas in it and was in operable condition when it was found, but it was
    high-centered and stuck in some sagebrush, and facing the wrong direction. All
    of Carnes's personal belongings, including his checkbook, were inside the vehicle.
    There were no indications of a struggle, and only a single set of footprints leading
    away from the scene. Curiously, the place where the truck was found is the same
    exit where Judith Casida's car was located after she disappeared in 2006. Authorities
    have no evidence that the two cases are connected, however. Carnes is a World
    War II veteran who served in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. He is also
    a former truck driver. He is close to his family and was in excellent health for
    his age at the time of his disappearance. Although there is no hard evidence of
    foul play in his case, his family and the police believe he came to harm. His
    disappearance remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Humboldt County Sheriff's
