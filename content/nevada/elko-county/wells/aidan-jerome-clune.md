  disappearance_details: Clune left his home in Sonoma County, California and traveled
    to Utah on April 26, 2022. He then went to Nevada and stayed the night in a hotel
    in Wells. He checked out of the hotel at 6:23 a.m. on April 27 and traveled south
    on U.S. Highway 93. This is the last time anyone saw him. At 8:50 a.m., a Nevada
    state trooper found Clune's red 2007 Nissan Frontier pickup truck with a damaged
    back bumper and duct tape on the driver's side mirror parked on the shoulder of
    Highway 93, near Mile Marker 23. There was no sign of Clune at the scene, and
    he'd left his wallet, knife and other personal belongings inside the truck. A
    search of the area turned up his tracks heading away from the pickup into the
    desert, however, and searchers tracked him for more than ten air miles. During
    that time, the footprints indicated he took off his shoes and was running for
    part of the time. The searchers never found him; he has never been heard from
    again. Police believe Clune may have had some kind of mental breakdown which caused
    him to run away, and that he made efforts to make sure he would not be found.
    His case remains unsolved. Sonoma County, California police are investigating.
