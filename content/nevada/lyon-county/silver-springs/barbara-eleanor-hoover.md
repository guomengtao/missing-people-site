  disappearance_details: Barbara's husband of 37 years, Robert Franklin "Bob" Hoover
    Jr., stated she packed two suitcases of clothing and left their home in the 5100
    block of Tamarack Street in Silver Springs, Nevada on the morning of September
    11, 2003, while Bob was at the bank. She was reportedly depressed and angry because
    the entirety of her father's inheritance had been left to her brother. According
    to Bob, Barbara told him she was going to the California coast to live with friends.
    He stated she took several thousand dollars and a year's supply of her bladder
    medicine with her, but did not take her car, a 1989 Pontiac Firebird. Within three
    weeks of Barbara's disappearance, Bob purchased a motorhome and went on a road
    trip through Nevada, California and Arizona. Bob claimed he maintained occasional
    contact with Barbara after her disappearance; he said he spoke to her on the phone
    and met her at a Jackson, Nevada coffeeshop in 2004, and that she used his health
    insurance. He never produced any proof of these encounters, however. Bob said
    he believed her friends in Merced, California may be helping her hide. The couple
    lived in Merced for several years before moving to Nevada. Barbara was reported
    missing by her son. She is described as a timid, reclusive woman, and her loved
    ones say it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning or to travel alone.
    Barbara's three children believe she was murdered, as it is uncharacteristic of
    her to be out of contact with them for so long; she kept in near-daily contact
    with them by phone. Barbara was declared legally dead in 2018. In February 2019,
    Bob died at the age of 86. Barbara's case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency
