  disappearance_details: Margaret was last seen in Silver Springs, Nevada on July
    2, 1999. She left her home at the 5 Star Mobile Home Park in the 1300 block of
    west 5th Street while her son, Timothy Ray Pennington, and his wife were watching
    television. Timothy and his wife said she wasn't acting unusual on the day of
    her disappearance. She has never been heard from again. She was reported missing
    on July 9. Although Margaret has dropped out of sight before, she's never been
    gone for this long, and she would always return home to pick up her Social Security
    check. Investigators believe she was the victim of a homicide and they have a
    suspect in her case, someone close to her. According to Margaret's friends, her
    husband had threatened her life on several occasions. Timothy was known to be
    violent as well; in 2000 he was convicted of kidnapping his estranged wife during
    their separation. He held her at gunpoint, shot at her, and held her captive for
    three or four hours. In 2012, after his release from prison for the kidnapping,
    Timothy murdered his girlfriend and then took his own life. It's not clear whether
    either Timothy or Margaret's husband were ever ruled out as suspects in her disappearance.
    Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Lyon County Sheriff's Office 775-463-6600
