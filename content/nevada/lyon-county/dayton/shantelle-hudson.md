  disappearance_details: Shantelle was last seen in Dayton, Nevada on November 14,
    1988. She got in an argument with her mother and left their apartment on Dayton
    Valley Road at 7:30 a.m. Her mother reported her as a missing person shortly afterwards.
    She stated her daughter had made friends she didn't approve of. There were two
    reported sightings of Shantelle in the month after she went missing, but police
    believe both sightings were probably misidentifications. She has never been heard
    from again. Authorities reopened her case after receiving an inquiry from one
    of her relatives in 1999. There has not been any activity on her Social Security
    number and investigators were unable to locate Shantelle through an extensive
    driver's license search. Shantelle had moved to Dayton from Bishop, California
    about two weeks before her disappearance. Some witnesses reported seeing Shantelle
    at a Dayton street dance two days after she was reported missing. It's possible
    she met with foul play at the dance. She may have been seeing a boy at the time
    of her disappearance; if she was, investigators have never identified him. Rumors
    that drugs were involved in her case have not been substantiated. Shantelle's
    father has been ruled out as a suspect in her case. Her mother now lives in Redding,
    California. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Lyon County Sheriff's
