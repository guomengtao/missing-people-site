  disappearance_details: Wheeler left his home in Everett, Washington and flew to
    Las Vegas, Nevada on May 26, 2010. He was going to visit his estranged wife, whom
    he had been supporting, and collect his pickup truck, espresso machine and other
    belongings. Wheeler took a plane to Las Vegas and landed shortly after 10:00 p.m.
    He told his sister he would call her once he reached his wife's home, but he never
    did. He has never been heard from again. On May 29, Wheeler's gold 2003 Toyota
    Tundra pickup truck with the Washington license plate number B06035B was found
    abandoned and burned in the desert at Quarry Road and Puma Road in Victorville,
    California. Someone had intentionally set a fire to it, using a flammable substance.
    The espresso machine Wheeler wanted to pick up was in the bed of the truck. Wheeler
    was a well-known businessman in the Seattle, Washington area prior to his disappearance.
    He operated several Grab N' Go coffee stands, where drive-through customers were
    served by attractive female baristas wearing bikinis. There was a scandal in 2009
    when five of the baristas were charged with sex work, for allegedly performing
    lewd acts for the coffee customers. Wheeler was also having financial problems.
    He had been sued for failure to pay a woman he purchased an espresso stand from,
    and the day before he was reported missing a warrant was issued for his arrest
    after he failed to appear in court in response to allegations that he owed nearly
    $20,000 in rent for a building he was leasing. In spite of this, however, his
    family states he is a loving father and grandfather who would not have left without
    warning. Authorities believe Wheeler is missing under suspicious circumstances.
    His case remains unsolved. Washington and California police are investigating.
