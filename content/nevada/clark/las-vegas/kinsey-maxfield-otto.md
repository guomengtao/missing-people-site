  disappearance_details: Otto lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2000. He took a Sun
    Country Airlines flight from Minnesota on May 13, 2000 to McCarran International
    Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. Authorities confirmed that Otto arrived in Las Vegas
    and visited several clubs in the city during the following days. Otto has a history
    of drug usage and investigators believe that he was in Las Vegas to complete a
    large deal for the drug Ecstasy. Otto was carrying a blue duffel bag and least
    $10,000 in cash when he departed from Minnesota. Otto called his father sometime
    after May 13 and claimed he was in Minneapolis visiting a friend who was hospitalized
    as the result of automobile accident injuries. Authorities believe that Otto's
    story was fabricated and that he was in Las Vegas when he phoned his father. Otto's
    father said that his son had signed a contract with a modeling agency in Chicago,
    Illinois prior to May 2000. He said Otto was planning to move to Illinois, but
    did not have enough money for the relocation. Authorities believe that Otto was
    hoping the drug deal would provide him with the funds to move. They suspect that
    Otto met with his drug dealer's contact in Las Vegas during his stay. The individual
    refused to cooperate with authorities regarding Otto's disappearance. This person
    had outstanding warrants against him at time Otto arrived in Nevada, for unrelated
    drug and weapons charges. Otto was scheduled to return home to Minneapolis on
    May 19, but his return ticket was never used. He has not been heard from again.
    Otto's family members stated he was devoted to his young son and would not have
    abandoned him. Investigators think it's unlikely that he completed the suspected
    drug deal and left with the money. Authorities believe that foul play was involved
    in Otto's case and theorize that he may have murdered as the result of a drug
    deal gone awry. His case remains unsolved. Both Nevada and Minnesota police are
    investigating. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 702-229-3521
