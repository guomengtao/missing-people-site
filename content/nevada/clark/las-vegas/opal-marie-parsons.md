  disappearance_details: Parsons was last seen at approximately 5:00 a.m. on August
    30, 2007 by her daughter at the residence they shared in the 100 block of Sir
    David Way in Las Vegas, Nevada. She was supposed to have lunch with friends at
    12:30 p.m. that day, but never arrived. When her daughter returned from work at
    2:00 p.m., Parsons was gone. Her van was still at the residence with the keys
    inside it, and no personal belongings were missing other than her purse. She has
    never been heard from again. Parsons left the television on and the door unlocked,
    with key inserted, when she disappeared, and she did not leave a note, which is
    uncharacteristic of her. She did not normally walk anywhere, preferring to drive
    her car instead. She was in good physical and mental health at the time of her
    disappearance, had no history of dementia, and is described as an active, social
    woman with many friends. Her hobbies include crossword puzzles and dancing. She
    belonged to the Heritage United Methodist Church in 2007. Parsons's ATM card was
    used at Sam's Town Casino in Las Vegas the day after she went missing. Authorities
    never believed Parsons used the card herself, because her image was not seen on
    the casino's surveillance video footage. Her driver's license and Social Security
    card were found lying on the floor inside the casino, near one of the exits. Investigators
    identified the man who used the ATM card, but did not arrest him. They stated
    he found Parsons's purse and cellular phone in a trash bin and is not a suspect
    in her disappearance. Investigators believe Parsons was lured away or abducted
    from her residence by someone she knew and trusted. There were no signs of forced
    entry to her home. Parsons kept a strict routine at the time of her disappearance
    and it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She is not wealthy;
    she lived on a retirement fund and Social Security checks. Foul play is suspected
    in her case due to the circumstances involved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas
