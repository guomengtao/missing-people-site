  disappearance_details: Kerr visited Mugshots Lounge in the 3300 block of South Sandhill
    Road in Las Vegas, Nevada during the late evening hours of September 25, 1997.
    He paid his bar tab and apparently planned to stop for dinner elsewhere. Kerr
    was last seen near the area of south Sandhill Road and the Flamingo Las Vegas,
    a Hilton-owned hotel in the 3500 block of Las Vegas Boulevard South, during the
    early morning hours of September 26. He has never been heard from again. He left
    all of his personal belongings behind, including his dented Ford pickup truck,
    tools, wallet, car keys, camping equipment and jewelry. His family members told
    authorities that it is uncharacteristic of him to leave without warning. Kerr's
    mother told reporters that her son was a heavy alcohol drinker in 1997. She also
    said that she believed he was involved with drugs, although she maintained that
    Kerr was not a frequent user. His mother believes that he was murdered as the
    result of his alleged connections to illegal narcotics, although nothing has been
    proven. Investigators said that there is little evidence available in Kerr's case,
    but foul play is suspected. Authorities stated that they located several potential
    suspects in his disappearance, but they could not arrest the individuals due to
    a lack of evidence. Kerr was employed as a carpet layer and electrician in 1997.
    He also has experience laying concrete. Kerr enjoys camping and often visited
    Mount Potosi near Las Vegas in the winter. He is described as an affable person
    who is willing to assist anyone in need. His case remains unsolved. Some agencies
    may list September 25, 1997 as the date of Kerr's disappearance. Investigating
