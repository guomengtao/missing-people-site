  disappearance_details: Janita was last seen in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 5, 2005.
    She was not reported missing for several months after her disappearance. She had
    placed an infant daughter for adoption decades earlier, and her daughter, Michelle
    Perkins, got in touch with her in 2004. The two women maintained regular contact
    afterwards and last spoke in September 2005. Perkins became concerned when she
    was unable to reach her afterwards, and conferred with other members of her biological
    family. The last confirmed contact was reported by a cousin, who saw Janita on
    October 5. None of her relatives had seen her since, and they contacted police
    in early 2006. Police officers made a welfare check on Janita's apartment on west
    Las Vegas Drive on February 21, 2006, and her husband of eighteen years, William
    Sites, answered the door. William told the investigators his wife had returned
    to California, where the couple had lived until moving to Las Vegas 2004. The
    police accepted his explanation and left without actually entering the apartment
    or seeing Janita. When Perkins heard the story, she became more concerned and
    filed a missing persons report. William was the prime suspect in Janita's disappearance
    from the onset of the investigation. Their marriage had been troubled and they
    had frequent arguments over money and other issues. Authorities secretly placed
    a GPS device on his car so they could track his movements. When investigators
    searched the Siteses' apartment, they found bloodstains and many of Janita's personal
    belongings, including her pets, cellular phone and driver's license. William began
    dating another woman in December 2005, two months after his wife went missing.
    In July 2006, he reportedly told her he had killed Janita. His girlfriend kept
    his story to herself for two months before going to authorities. Investigators
    interviewed William about Janita's disappearance four times. He initially claimed
    Janita had moved back to California alone, then said she had left him for another
    man. On the third interview he said Janita was deceased; he claimed she had threatened
    him with a knife and he hit or pushed her in self-defense, causing her death.
    On the fourth interview he confessed to murder, stating he had beaten Janita to
    death with a hammer sometime during October 2005. William said he had dismembered
    his wife's body three days after her death, put the remains in bags, and put the
    bags in the trash. In October 2006, William was arrested and charged with Janita's
    murder. Authorities stated they had not found Janita's body and did not expect
    to find it, but they believed they had enough evidence to prove she was murdered
    by her husband. William admitted to causing Janita's death and concealing her
    body, but maintained it had been self-defense. In September 2007, he pleaded guilty
    to second-degree murder, destroying evidence, and the theft of $2,500 in Janita's
    Social Security benefits. He was sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison. Janita
    had been a Bank of America executive, but retired on disability prior to her disappearance.
    Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances involved. Investigating

Janita was last seen in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 5, 2005. She was not reported missing for several months after her disappearance.
