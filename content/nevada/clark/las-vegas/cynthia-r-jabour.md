  disappearance_details: Jabour was last seen in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 5, 1980.
    She had been dating a man named Robert Weeks off and on for almost six years,
    and she was last seen in the lobby of his condo at 10:30 p.m. They had a dinner
    date scheduled that night and she told friends she planned to end their relationship
    due to his jealousy and possessive behavior. She has never been heard from again.
    Two days later, a friend who was concerned about being unable to reach Jabour
    forced her way into her apartment. There was no indication of her whereabouts
    there and no belongings were missing. After her disappearance, her car was found
    abandoned in the parking lot Caesar's Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. She left behind
    expensive clothing, and $47,000 in a securities account. When questioned by police,
    Robert claimed Jabour had canceled their dinner date that night and he didn't
    know where she was. He was supposed to take a lie detector test, but on the day
    of the test he canceled the appointment, saying he had to go out of town on business.
    He went to Tijuana, Mexico, and then on to Chile. He didn't return to the U.S.
    until three years later, coming in through Houston, Texas on a Libyan passport.
    Robert moved to San Diego, California and started using the name Robert Howard
    Smith. He started seeing a nurse named Carol Ann Riley, but Riley was seeing another
    man as well, a doctor from Colorado, and planned to end her relationship with
    Robert and marry the doctor. Riley disappeared on April 5, 1986. She had a dinner
    date scheduled with Robert that night and planned to break up with him. After
    her disappearance, her car was found abandoned in a San Diego hotel parking lot.
    When questioned by police, Robert claimed Riley had canceled their dinner date
    and he had no idea what happened to her. On April 7, just two days after Riley's
    disappearance, he left town, telling his roommate he was going on a business trip,
    and dropped out of sight. Authorities subsequently learned that Robert was using
    a false name; he had a history of going by different names and identities. They
    also found out that Robert's ex-wife, Patricia Weeks, disappeared from Las Vegas
    on April 25, 1968, a few weeks after their divorce had been finalized and she
    had been granted custody of their four young children. After her disappearance,
    her car was found abandoned in a parking lot. Robert told people that Patricia
    "either had a nervous breakdown or is probably dead." James Shaw, a business associate
    of Robert's, had disappeared from Las Vegas on May 5, 1971. His bloodstained car
    was later found abandoned. Acquaintances said he had argued with Robert the day
    he disappeared. Police launched a manhunt for Robert, and he and the four disappearances
    were profiled on the television show Unsolved Mysteries. Thanks to tips from people
    who saw the show, in April 1987 he was located in Tucson, Arizona, where he'd
    been living under the name Charles F. Stolzenberg. He was arrested on an outstanding
    embezzlement charge out of Nevada, and questioned about the four disappearances.
    In July 1987, he was indicted for Patricia and Jabour's murders. A photo of Robert
    is posted with this case summary. At his trial, numerous witnesses testified that
    he was a controlling and abusive man, prone to jealous rages. Two of his and Patricia's
    children took the stand to talk about how their father had beaten their mother
    on numerous occasions; others corroborated this, and Patricia had twice gotten
    restraining orders against her husband. Witnesses also testified that when Robert
    saw Patricia sitting next to a male neighbor on a piano bench, he beat the man
    so severely he was unrecognizable, and didn't regain consciousness for three days.
    Passages from Robert's diary were presented for the jury; he wrote bitterly about
    Jabour, saying, "You have humiliated me beyond belief. I will even the score."
    The jury was permitted to hear about Riley's suspicious disappearance as well.
    In April 1988, he was convicted of Patricia's murder and Jabour's murder and sentenced
    to life in prison without parole. It was the first time in Nevada history that
    someone was convicted of murder without the victim's body. He died in prison in
    1996; he was never charged in Riley and Shaw's disappearances. In July 2025, Riley's
    remains were identified. They had been found actually been found decades earlier,
    in 1987. A rancher found a human skull on the ground, then a search turned up
    a shallow grave with more remains wrapped in a blanket. By the time Riley's remains
    were identified, the bones themselves were gone. The unidentified skeleton had
    been cremated in 2016 and the ashes scattered at an unknown location. Authorities
    only had the dental records to prove the identification, as well as her clothing
    and the blanket in which her remains had been wrapped. They had sent portions
    of those items to a lab to try to extract DNA from but the efforts were unsuccessful.
    None of the other missing persons associated with Robert have ever been found.
    He was interested in mining, and may have dumped them in mine shafts in the Nevada
    desert. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 702-828-3111
