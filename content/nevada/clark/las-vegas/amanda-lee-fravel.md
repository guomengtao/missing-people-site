  disappearance_details: Fravel in moved from her home state of California to Las
    Vegas, Nevada in 1985. She stayed with a friend and her friend's family at first,
    then moved into a place of her own, but found that too expensive and moved in
    with a roommate. She had a job at a Taco Bell restaurant. In June 1986, her mother
    sent her money so she could come home to Rancho Cordova, California to visit.
    Fravel never arrived in California, however. She was last seen on June 13, 1986;
    her roommate, Lew Frank, said she left their apartment on south 3rd Street. She
    was planning to pick up her paycheck at Taco Bell and visit her ex-boyfriend.
    Fravel had no vehicle and it's unclear what her means of transportation was that
    day; there are reports that she was a frequent hitchhiker, but a friend said she
    had stopped hitchhiking entirely by the time she disappeared after she had a bad
    experience. She never arrived at either of her destinations and has never been
    heard from again. A few weeks after Fravel's disappearance, her mother and stepfather
    came to Las Vegas to investigate her case. They met with her ex-boyfriend and
    with her roommate. All of Fravel's things in the apartment were packed up, and
    her two kittens had reportedly not been fed or cared for since she went missing.
    Fravel is described as a caring pet owner who would not have willingly left her
    kittens without food. Fravel's mother and stepfather and her friend were all suspicious
    of Frank. He appeared to be in his late forties in 1986, and many of the visitors
    to the apartment were much younger people. He stated he was from Georgia, although
    he spoke without any discernible accent, and said he had come to Nevada to open
    up a brothel. There is no record of Frank in Nevada state records and it's possible
    the name "Lew Frank" was an alias. His current whereabouts are unknown and he
    has never been named as a suspect in Fravel's disappearance. Fravel had had an
    unhappy home and family life and a chaotic upbringing in California, and although
    her mother had purchased her a plane ticket to go back there, her friend said
    she thought Fravel would have never returned home due to the unfortunate situation
    there. Fravel reportedly told her friend she wanted to go to Canada to meet a
    musician who lived there. Foul play is suspected in Fravel's case. Her disappearance
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department
