  disappearance_details: Roberts and her live-in boyfriend of one year, Phillip Johnson,
    disappeared from their home in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 29, 2012. They disappeared
    together with an unregistered black 2012 Chevrolet Cruze; a photo of a similar
    vehicle is posted with this case summary. Both of them worked for the postal service.
    After a week passed without Roberts showing up for work at the post office, her
    family conducted a welfare check and found the home vacant. On the evening of
    October 3, Johnson left his and Roberts's two-month-old son, as well as his son
    from a previous relationship, with his mother in Torrance, California. He was
    driving his and Roberts's car at the time; it was later located in Compton, California.
    Roberts wasn't seen with him in Torrance and neither of them have been seen or
    heard from since. They were reported missing on October 9. Although there was
    no evidence of foul play in the home and the police haven't named Johnson as a
    suspect, Roberts's family believes he may have harmed her. They stated she'd been
    planning to leave him because she thought he'd been unfaithful. A metal trash
    can which Johnson purchased shortly before he disappeared and kept in the garage
    also vanished at the same time he and Roberts did. There had been a fire in the
    trash can that left a scorch mark on the garage floor and ash and soot stains
    on the ceiling. Authorities stated Roberts and Johnson are missing under suspicious
    circumstances. Their cases remain unsolved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Police
