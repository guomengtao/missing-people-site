  disappearance_details: Guzman's family last saw her in Las Vegas, Nevada during
    December 2008. She has never been heard from again. She left behind three young
    children, and her family didn't believe she would have abandoned them. She told
    her family she wanted to move to Colorado or Oklahoma, but her estranged husband,
    Francisco Vazquez-Rosas, wouldn't let her take the children with her. Vazquez-Rosas
    said his wife had run away with another man, but her family stated she would not
    have left Las Vegas without telling anyone. Guzman's brother-in-law reported her
    missing in May 2009. In January 2010, Vazquez-Rosas was indicted for his wife's
    murder. They had been separated for about three months by the time of her disappearance.
    In December 2009, the couple's five-year-old daughter told an adult female relative
    that she'd seen her father choke her mother and then put her in a closet, then
    in a trash bag. The child's seven-year-old sister told a similar story, saying
    her parents had been fighting and then she saw her father put her mother in a
    garbage can. The police interviewed Vazquez-Rosas, and he failed a polygraph test.
    He eventually confessed to Guzman's murder. According to him, on December 13 he
    and Guzman were together at an apartment in the 3100 block of south Nellis Boulevard.
    Guzman told him she was leaving and taking the children, and she wouldn't say
    where she planned to go. They began fighting and he pushed her out the door, and
    she fell down onto the asphalt. He hid her body in a closet when he realized she
    was dead, then later put it in a trash bin. A photograph of Vazquez-Rosas is posted
    with this case summary. His attorney stated he is innocent and suggested Guzman
    left of her own accord. Both he and Guzman are undocumented immigrants from Mexico,
    and his attorney claimed Vazquez-Rosas didn't report his wife's disappearance
    to authorities because he feared deportation. The murder charge against Vazquez-Rojas
    was dismissed in April 2010, four months after he was indicted, after a judge
    ruled his confession had been coerced. Charges could be brought against him again,
    however, if more evidence surfaces. Foul play is suspected in Guzman's disappearance
    due to the circumstances involved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan
