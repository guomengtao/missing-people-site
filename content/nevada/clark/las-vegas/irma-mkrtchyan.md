  disappearance_details: Mkrtchyan was last seen near south Durango Drive and the
    West Desert Inn in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 19, 2014. She worked as an insurance
    broker for Farmers Insurance and met with a client at the Allanza Apartments.
    She texted her boss to say she had to miss work to attend her ex-husband's aunt's
    funeral in California. She has never been seen again, and it turned out there
    was no family funeral in California. Mkrtchyan texted her loved ones saying she
    was in California on a business trip, not for a funeral. She wrote she had left
    her car at the Allanza apartment complex with the keys hidden in the gas tank
    cap, and that she would return in a few days. She said that her phone battery
    was was dying because she'd left the charger at home, something that's uncharacteristic
    of her, because she needed the phone for her job. Mkrtchyan lived with her ex-husband,
    Ara Marutyan, in the 8900 block of Coast Walk Circle at the time of her disappearance.
    They have a son and daughter who were both in college in 2014, the son at a local
    university and the daughter in Illinois. Mkrtchyan and Marutyan divorced in 2007
    after a sixteen-year marriage; he claims the parting was amicable. However, other
    witnesses stated Mkrtchyan had once been brutally beaten by her husband, and that
    she told her daughter and others that she was afraid he might kill her. Her brother,
    who lives in New York City, stated he didn't think Mkrtchyan would have abandoned
    her family, especially as their mother had had a recent heart attack. Marutyan
    failed a lie detector test after Mkrtchyan's disappearance, and police believe
    he has lied to them, but he maintains his innocence. Their son was also investigated.
    A private investigator believes Armenian organized crime figures may have been
    involved in Mkrtchyan's case, and speculated that identity theft may have been
    the motive. Mkrtchyan's ex-husband and son, however, stated she'd been talking
    about Mexico prior to her disappearance, and that she was communicating with a
    man online; her son said he thought she'd gone to the Baja California region of
    that country with a love interest. Mkrtchyan was born in Soviet Armenia and moved
    to the United States as an adult. She has a master's degree in mechanical engineering
    from an Armenian university, and also attended the Manhattan School of Computer
    Technology. She left behind her suitcase, all her clothes and her other belongings.
    She has no history of mental illness or unstable behavior and it's uncharacteristic
    of her to leave without warning. Authorities believe foul play was involved in
    Mkrtchyan's disappearance, and they're investigating it as a possible homicide.
