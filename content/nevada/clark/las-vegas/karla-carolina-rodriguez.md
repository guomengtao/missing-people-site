  disappearance_details: Karla was last seen at approximately 7:00 p.m. on October
    20, 1999 in the 800 block of Bonita Avenue in Las Vegas, Nevada. She went to visit
    a neighbor's son to play with him, but the neighbor told her to go home because
    it was getting late. She played outside alone for about fifteen minutes before
    leaving on her bike. The location was two blocks from her family's home and also
    near the Stratosphere Tower in downtown Las Vegas. Karla never returned to her
    house and has not been seen again. She wasn't reported missing until the next
    morning. Her father spoke to the neighbor who saw Karla, assumed she must have
    gone to another friend's house, and went home to bed. The next morning, when she
    still wasn't home, her mother called the school to see if she'd gone there for
    classes. The school principal called the police at this time. Karla's disappearance
    was originally thought to be linked to a debt her parents owed a former brother-in-law. A
    few months before Karla disappeared, the brother-in-law came to Las Vegas and
    demanded to be repaid. The family gave him $1,000, but he said that was only the
    interest and he wanted more money. It was theorized that the man abducted Karla
    in attempt to extort money from her parents, but he has since been ruled out as
    a suspect in her case. Investigators now believe Karla was taken by someone outside
    her family. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas
