  disappearance_details: Mitchell was last seen at her residence Regatta Apartments
    in the vicinity of the 2100 block of Sandy Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada on August
    18, 1999. Neighbors saw her get into a blue Dodge or Toyota truck with a pool
    company logo on the side. It was driven by two males, one of whom was Black and
    the other Hispanic. She has never been heard from again. One of the men who was
    in the truck with her eventually returned to the area and said he didn't know
    Mitchell's whereabouts. He was questioned by police and cleared as a suspect in
    Mitchell's case. Nathan Burkett lived in the same apartment complex as Mitchell,
    and they knew each other. A photo of him is posted with this case summary. Burkett
    has an extensive criminal record, mostly for violent offenses. He pleaded guilty
    to manslaughter in the deaths of two women, one of whom was his mother. DNA linked
    him to the murders of three more women, two from Las Vegas and one from the Los
    Angeles, California area. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree
    murder in Nevada and was sentenced to ten years to life in prison. He died in
    prison in 2021, age 74. It isn't clear whether Burkett was involved in Mitchell's
    case, and he hasn't been named as a suspect. Mitchell left behind six children.
    She lived with her brother at the time of her disappearance; he stated it wasn't
    unusual for her to drop out of sight for a few days at a time, but she was never
    gone for very long. Her case was mistakenly closed in 2000, but reopened after
    the police realized she was still missing. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating
