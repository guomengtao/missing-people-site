  disappearance_details: Leone resided in the 3000 block of West Tecos Avenue in Las
    Vegas, Nevada with her boyfriend, David Dale Morgan, and their two children. A
    photograph of David is posted with this case summary. Leone and David met in 1981,
    when she was 16 and he was 50 years old. She moved into his home and started working
    at one of his businesses, Abacus Mini-Storage, shortly afterwards. There is a
    long-standing history of domestic violence in their relationship. David was charged
    with her attempted murder in 1989 after he beat her with a pipe and Leone suffered
    numerous fractures. The charges were dropped after Leone refused to testify against
    him in court. David was arrested for additional alleged domestic violence incidents
    in May 1997 and March 1999. He was also charged with child endangerment in January
    1992. Leone continuously refused to cooperate with authorities and all domestic
    violence charges were eventually dropped against David. Leone was last seen in
    Las Vegas sometime during February 2000. She left all of her personal belongings
    behind at her residence, including her clothes, money and vehicle. She has never
    been heard from again. David never reported her as a missing person. He claimed
    that Leone was having an affair with a man named "Tim" and said that she left
    Las Vegas with him. One of Leone's family members alerted law enforcement about
    her disappearance in October 2000, eight months after she vanished. Leone and
    David's seven-year-old daughter told authorities that she witnessed her parents
    having an argument the night before Leone disappeared. The child said that David
    pushed Leone through a plate glass window inside their residence, then smashed
    her head into their refrigerator. It is believed that the fight revolved around
    David's belief that Leone was conducting an affair. Authorities stated that they
    located a male friend of Leone's in October 2000. Reportedly, David believed that
    she was romantically involved with the individual. Investigators said that there
    was no evidence Leone and the man were having an affair. Officials are still attempting
    to verify the existence of "Tim." The couple's home was searched in November 2000
    and investigators announced they discovered evidence that suggested Leone did
    not leave of her own accord. Authorities said that foul play was suspected in
    her disappearance. Drops of blood were located inside the couple's home and near
    Leone's vehicle. Investigators did not disclose whether the blood was identified
    as Leone's. David's second wife, Marie Morgan, also vanished under suspicious
    circumstances from Las Vegas in 1980, 20 years prior to Leone's disappearance. Records
    showed that an employee of the city's Women's Crisis Center reported Marie as
    a missing person shortly after her disappearance. Marie received assistance from
    the center after she reported David's alleged abuse. He never contacted authorities
    regarding his wife's disappearance and said that he believed Marie left with her
    boyfriend, Gabriel Vincent. Vincent apparently took photographs of Marie performing
    sex acts and attempted to blackmail David with them prior to her disappearance.
    David was enraged by this. Vincent disappeared in November 1979. Fred Hackett,
    one of David's employees, later admitted he helped David dispose of Vincent's
    body. David later confessed his murder to Marie's sister, Kim Smith. He said he
    ambushed Vincent at the storage facility Vincent rented from him, shot him in
    the groin and tortured him before shooting him to death. He told Smith he buried
    the remains and covered the grave with quicklime to hasten decomposition. Authorities
    believe he may have moved the body sometime later. David's sister, Deloris Morgan,
    came forward in 1985 and claimed that David forced her at gunpoint to help him
    relocate Marie's remains in the Nevada desert in 1980. Deloris stated that they
    buried the body in a large hole along Highway 95 past Indian Springs, Nevada near
    mile marker 124. She claimed that David forced her to move the body again several
    months afterwards. She said that he filled a 55-gallon drum with water and instructed
    her to haul water buckets while he poured cement over the gravesite. Deloris attempted
    to lead law enforcement officials to the location, but she was unable to identify
    the site. She died of natural causes in 1987. Donald Cowan, a former business
    associate of Morgan's disappeared in 1982. Authorities now believe David was involved
    in Cowan's disappearance, but little information is available in his case. David
    hired an attorney after Leone's 2000 disappearance. He owns a furniture moving
    business in addition to the storage units. Authorities estimated that David was
    worth two million dollars in 2000. In 2007, he was arrested and charged with Vincent's
    murder. The case was reopened after Fred Hackett told police he witnessed David
    murder Vincent and helped dispose of the body. Hackett's account of Vincent's
    murder is similar to Smith's account of David's confession. The murder case against
    David was dropped in 2012, however, because Hackett had died and prosecutors couldn't
    prove David's guilt without his testimony. Cowan, Marie and Leone's cases remain
    unsolved and charges have been not filed against anyone in connection with their
    disappearances, but David is considered to be the prime suspect in their cases.
    Authorities don't believe Leone would have left of her own accord and abandoned
    her daughter, whom she was very close to. She also left behind a teenage son.
    Her body has never been found. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
