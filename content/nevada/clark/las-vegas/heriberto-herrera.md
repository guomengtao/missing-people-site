  disappearance_details: 'Herrera was last seen in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 14, 2010.
    He drove to see his sister at her workplace, the Clark County School District
    Police Department. He wasn''t able to see her, but he did speak to her on the
    phone later that day. He told her his wife had left him and taken their children
    while he was asleep, and he had reported them missing. At 3:00 p.m., Herrera''s
    wife returned to their home in the Summerlin neighborhood with a police escort
    to pick up some belongings. She and the police saw Herrera at that time, and that
    evening he called her. He has never been heard from again. Herrera''s wife, Johanna
    Blake, said he had a severe psychotic episode on the night of April 19. He said
    he had been severely depressed for a long time, and was admitted to the Spring
    Mountain Treatment Center for his mental illness. He was diagnosed with bipolar
    disorder, schizoaffective disorder and depression with psychotic features, and
    discharged on April 29 with a recommendation for outpatient treatment. Blake stated
    she took the children and left on May 14 because Herrera was acting oddly and
    aggressively and she was concerned for her safety and theirs. The couple''s two-year-old
    twin sons had been premature and Herrera was their primary caregiver. The same
    day Herrera reported them all missing, the police made contact with them and verified
    their well-being, and the missing persons reports were voided. Blake returned
    to their home that afternoon to get her things. Later that evening, Herrera called
    her and said he loved her and their sons. A month after his disappearance, on
    June 15, Herrera''s car was found on Mount Charleston, Nevada, near the Mary Jane
    Falls trailhead. The vehicle, a White four-door Toyota 4Runner with the Nevada
    license plate number 722MLR, had been registered to his mother. A photo of it
    is posted with  this case summary. Inside it was a packed suitcase, medication,
    a package of bottled water with one bottle missing, and other belongings. Herrera
    does not enjoy going into the mountains and it would be uncharacteristic of him
    to drive there. In August 2011, hikers found a box full of Herrera''s financial
    records and other personal belongings at the 9,500 foot elevation level on Mount
    Charleston. Among other things, the box held 25 credit cards and cash. There was
    no other sign of him in the area. Authorities stated the trail was very steep
    and they didn''t think Herrera, who had asthma and wasn''t an experienced hiker,
    could have made it up that high. Prior to his disappearance, Herrera had suddenly
    stopped contacting his sisters, whom he was close to. The last time either of
    them heard from him was on April 19, when he called one sister the day before
    her birthday and left a birthday message. His sisters stated they had never known
    their brother to have mental problems. Herrera was born in Puerto Rico and came
    to the mainland United States as a young child. He has lived in the Las Vegas
    area for most of his life, attended Las Vegas High School and had worked in the
    casino industry for about fifteen years prior to his disappearance. His family
    doesn''t believe he would have abandoned them without contact. His case remains
    unsolved. Above: Herrera''s car Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitian Police
