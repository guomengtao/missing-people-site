  disappearance_details: Randi was last seen between 11:30 p.m. on February 15 and
    12:30 a.m. on February 16, 1992. He was wrapped in a blanket and asleep on the
    living room floor of his family's residence at in the 300 block of east Rochelle
    Avenue in Las Vegas, Nevada. Randi's family held a birthday party for his father,
    Mike Evers, during the evening at the home. They hosted approximately 15 guests.
    Randi apparently disappeared during the party and has never been seen again. It
    was deemed unlikely that he wandered outside on his own, as it was cold that night
    and Randi was afraid of the dark. Randi's family speculates that he was kidnapped,
    but authorities initially suspected some of Randi's family members of being involved
    in his case. Randi's father and his stepmother, Tina Evers, did not participate
    in the search for him. Mike had to be literally dragged out of bed when police
    told him Randi was missing. Neither Mike nor Tina showed very much interest in
    the case. Photos of them as they appeared around the time of Randi's disappearance
    are posted with this case summary. Tina's alibi of her whereabouts at the time
    her stepson disappeared reportedly showed numerous small inconsistencies. She
    claimed she and several of their friends left the party at 11:30 p.m. to go to
    the Gold Coast, a local casino. They left Randi alone in the company of an adult
    guest at the party who had passed out on the living room couch. Mike may have
    been with Tina and the rest of the group, or he may have been asleep in the back
    bedroom during this time period. When the group returned at approximately 3:30
    a.m., Randi was missing. An extensive search of the surrounding area failed to
    turn up any clues to his whereabouts. Mike and Tina had a son and then left the
    area for southern California four years after Randi was last seen. They divorced
    sometime after that. There have been no reported problems with their daughter,
    born prior to Randi's disappearance, or their son, born after. Police say Mike
    and Tina were not very cooperative in the investigation into their child's disappearance
    but they did not try to avoid authorities. There has been much speculation about
    what caused Randi to disappear, including theories that he was sold; killed accidentally
    or intentionally by his father and/or stepmother after Mike's birthday party broke
    up; or was abducted by a stranger, a family friend, or his biological mother.
    None of these theories have been substantiated, however. Nearly everyone involved
    in his case, except the investigators, has left the Las Vegas area in the years
    following his disappearance. Randi's biological mother, who lived in southern
    California at the time of his disappearance and had legal custody of Randi, is
    still alive. Mike died in 2014. In 2022, when a journalist with the Las Vegas
    Review Journal contacted Tina to talk to her about the case, she refused to comment
    except to say, "You guys have ruined my family. The police have ruined my family."
    She stated she wanted to be left alone. A Nevada grand jury was given evidence
    by investigators some time after Randi disappeared, but indictments were not handed
    down. Randi's case remains open and unsolved. In a media interview in the spring
    of 2015, a detective investigating the case said he had gotten a hit on Randi's
    DNA in a database and he believes Randi is alive and living in the western United
    States. Due to the confusion as to what happened to him, Randi's disappearance
    is being investigated as a non-family abduction. Investigating Agency Las Vegas
