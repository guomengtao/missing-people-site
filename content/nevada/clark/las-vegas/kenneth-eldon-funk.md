    struck the front of their boat. She wasn't wearing a life jacket, and Funk grabbed
    one and jumped into the water to save her. Before the couple could get back aboard
    the boat, the wind sent it drifting away from them. Funk and his wife treaded
    water for forty minutes, before Funk told her to let him go, and he sank in the
    water. Meanwhile, their grandson and their daughter's former boyfriend were still
    on the boat, which was adrift; the engine would not restart. One of them called
    the National Park Service (NPS) for help at 9:00 a.m., but he didn't know his
    exact location or his launch point, and it took an NPS pilot to spot the stranded
    boat and Funk's wife in the water. NPS ranger picked up Funk's wife, and a search
    for him was launched, but his body has never been found. He worked as a slot technical
    manager at Sunset Station, and left behind three children. Investigating Agency
