  disappearance_details: Diamond was last seen in the 4400 block of Boulder Highway
    in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 7, 1987. She told her oldest son that she was
    going to the store and would return later. She left with a friend in a maroon
    and red 1982 Mercury Capri with the California license plate number 1JWZ930. Later
    that night, Diamond's youngest son woke up with a nosebleed and couldn't find
    his mother, so asked his older brother for help with it. Afterwards the boys went
    back to sleep. When they woke up in the morning for school, Diamond still wasn't
    back home. She has never been seen or heard from again. Her boyfriend reported
    her missing on February 8. In May, three months after Diamond disappeared, her
    vehicle which she was last seen in was found abandoned in a parking lot in the

    evidence but nothing was found. The circumstances of Diamond's disappearance are
    unclear. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 702-828-3111
