  disappearance_details: Landon disappeared from Las Vegas, Nevada on June 23, 2008.
    He was abducted by his non-custodial mother, Victoria League-Lopez. A felony warrant
    is on file for her. A photo of Victoria is posted with this case summary. Her
    date of birth is August 20, 1977, making her 30 years old at the time of Landon's
    abduction. She's described as Hispanic, 5'4 and 125 pounds, with black hair and
    brown eyes. Victoria may use the last names Lopez and/or Lopez-Garcia. She has
    a scar on her lower back. Victoria picked Landon up from his father for a weekend
    visitation. Later, she called Landon's father to say she was "moving some stuff"
    and asked if she could keep the child a little while longer. Landon's father agreed.
    He never saw his son again. Victoria took him and fled. Victoria and Landon may
    be traveling in a blue 1998 Toyota Corolla with the Nevada license plate number
    523UAG. They may be in Guadalajara, Mexico. Victoria has several relatives in
    Mexico, as well as one brother in California. There is some concern for Landon's
    safety, as Victoria has a history of domestic violence. Landon's whereabouts are
    unknown and his case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan
