  disappearance_details: Most reports state Dardandes was last seen in the vicinity
    of the 300 block of south Casino Center Boulevard in Las Vegas, Nevada during
    May 1994. She was married to Gary Dotson at the time. She had told friends she
    was afraid but did not give the reason for her fears. She was reported missing
    in 1994 or 1995, but the report was deleted three months later. A new report was
    made in 2003. Dardanes was involved in crack and marijuana use and sex work at
    the time of her disappearance; she also had a misdemeanor warrant out for her
    arrest. Decades after she was last seen, her daughter found out she was actually
    in police custody at the time the initial missing persons report was filed. She
    was arraigned on September 26, 1994; she found the record of the arraignment.
    She was last seen walking away from the Clark County Detention Center after being
    released following a drug test. This is the last indication of Dardanes's whereabouts.
    Her last known address was at Siegel Apartments in the 2100 block of Paradise
    Road. She never showed up for her court date and never contacted family again.
    Dotson was wrongfully convicted of rape in 1975; DNA testing later proved he could
    not have committed the crime and the accuser admitted she had made up her story
    and gave him $17,500 compensation. He met and married Dardanes after his release
    from prison. Dardanes has worked as a bartender, a waitress, a dancer, and a store
    clerk in the past. She left behind a daughter when she disappeared. Her loved
    ones say it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning, and she is considered
    to be endangered. Investigating Agency Clark County Sheriff's Office 702-229-2907
