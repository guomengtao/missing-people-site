  disappearance_details: Marie was last seen in the 5800 block of Michelin Circle
    in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 10, 1980. Her husband, David Dale Morgan, is the prime
    suspect in her disappearance; a photo of him is posted with this case summary.
    Marie was reported missing by an employee of the Women's Crisis Center, a women's
    shelter Marie had sought assistance from when she wanted to escape David's abuse.
    In 1979, Marie had had an affair with Gabriel Vincent. Vincent took photographs
    of her performing sex acts and attempted to blackmail David with them. David was
    enraged by this. Vincent disappeared on November 15, 1979 and has never been heard
    from again. Marie disappeared seven months after Vincent did. In 1985, David's
    sister, Deloris Morgan, came forward and said David had confessed to murdering
    both of them. She said David had forced her at gunpoint to help him move Marie's
    remains in the Nevada desert in 1980. They buried the body along Highway 95 past
    Indian Springs, Nevada, near mile marker 124. Deloris says her brother forced
    her to move the body again several months later. He covered Marie's gravesite
    with cement. Deloris attempted to lead investigators to the location, but she
    was unable to identify the site. She died of natural causes in 1987. In 2007,
    David was arrested and charged with Vincent's murder. The case was reopened after
    a witness told police he witnessed David murder Vincent and helped dispose of
    the body. The murder case against David was dropped in 2012, however, because
    the witness had died and prosecutors couldn't prove David's guilt without his
    testimony. David is also believed to be responsible for the disappearance of Donald
    Cowan, a former business associate of his, in 1982 and the disappearance of his
    girlfriend, Diana Leone, in 2000. Cowan, Marie and Leone's cases remain unsolved
    and charges have been not filed against anyone in connection with their disappearances.
