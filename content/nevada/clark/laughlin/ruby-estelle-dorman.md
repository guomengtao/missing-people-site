  disappearance_details: Dorman finished her shift at the Flamingo in Laughlin, Nevada,
    where she was a buffet hostess, at 2:26 p.m. on April 20, 2003. She clocked out,
    changed out of her uniform and went to the parking garage where her White Honda
    Accord was on the fifth floor. She should have arrived home at approximately 2:45
    p.m., but Dorman's roommate was asleep at the time and did not know when she got
    in. Her car was later found parked outside her mobile home with her purse and
    keys inside it. Dorman's daughter, Juliann White, whose birth name was Juanita
    White, called Dorman's roommate on the morning of April 20 and asked directions
    to the residence. Investigators believe they left together after Dorman returned
    home from work. At 4:50 p.m. that day, White returned to Dorman's house alone,
    driving Dorman's Honda. She dropped it off and drove away in her own Jeep Cherokee.
    Dorman has never been heard from again. No evidence was found in her car when
    police searched it. Foul play is suspected in Dorman's disappearance and investigators
    are treating it as a homicide. White is a suspect in her case; she has a history
    of mental illness and a long-standing enmity towards her mother and had threatened
    her in the past. Among other things, White believes that Dorman ordered the homicidal
    cult leader Charles Manson and his followers to murder Rosemary LaBianca, White's
    aunt on her father's side, in 1969. (There is no evidence that Manson or any of
    his followers had any connection to Dorman.) White was interviewed twice by authorities
    after her mother's disappearance and reportedly gave inconsistent statements.
    She denied driving Dorman's car or seeing her at all the day she vanished, although
    Dorman's roommate witnessed her doing both. White moved away a short time after
    her mother disappeared and investigators have not been able to locate her for
    a third interview. There is insufficient evidence to charge her in her mother's
    case. Dorman is described as a very reliable person who had not missed a single
    day of work for 20 years prior to April 2003. Her credit cards have not been used
    since her disappearance. No has been charged in connection with her case; it remains
    unsolved. Investigating Agency Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 702-298-2223
