  disappearance_details: 'Jennifer was last seen at approximately 3:00 p.m. in the
    Lemmon Valley area of Reno, Nevada on June 28, 1987. She bought candy and a soda
    a 7-11 convenience store on Lemmon Valley Drive and disappeared while walking
    away from the business towards her home on Surge Street, just a few hundred feet
    away. Jennifer should have arrived home in less than five minutes, but she never
    did. When twenty minutes passed and she hadn''t come back, her older brother went
    to the 7-11 to look for her, and couldn''t find her. She has never been heard
    from again. Authorities treated Jennifer''s disappearance as a possible abduction
    from the onset of the investigation. A White pickup truck seen in the area at
    the time was eventually accounted for, but witnesses also saw a light-colored
    Toyota Corolla that was never identified. It''s unclear whether the vehicle had
    anything to do with her disappearance. Jennifer is described as an independent
    child who was capable of asserting herself around adults and wouldn''t have willingly
    gone into a stranger''s car. Her family had moved to Nevada from Clearwater, Florida
    ten months earlier, and she seemed to be settling in well. She had no history
    of running away from home, and she was cautious and always let her family know
    where she was. No strong suspects have ever been identified in Jennifer''s disappearance;
    it remains unsolved. Her mother has kept the same phone number the family had
    in 1987, hoping Jennifer might call home someday. Investigating Agency Washoe
