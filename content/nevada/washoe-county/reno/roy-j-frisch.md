  disappearance_details: Frisch was last seen in Reno, Nevada on March 22, 1934. He
    left his home in the 200 block of Court Street at 7:45 p.m. and walked to the
    Majestic Theater, where he saw a movie. After the film a friend saw Frisch at
    the corner of Sierra and Court Streets. He never arrived home and has never been
    heard from again. At the time of his disappearance, Frisch lived with his mother
    and two sisters and worked for Riverside Bank of Reno as a cashier. He was supposed
    to testify against William Graham and James McKay in an upcoming mail fraud case.
    Graham and McKay were noted in the area for their involvement in organized crime.
    In January 1934, Frisch had testified against four other suspects thought to be
    involved in the fraud case. He disappeared before he could testify against Graham
    and McKay, however. The gangster George "Baby Face" Nelson is a possible suspect
    in Frisch's disappearance. He was a former driver for Graham and frequently visited
    Reno. He is known to have arrived there on March 20 and to have left on March
    22, the dsame day Frisch disappeared, and later said he had "done a job" for Graham
    and McKay. In 1935, one of Nelson's associates, John Paul Chase, confessed he
    was with Nelson and witnessed Frisch's murder. He said Nelson waited for Frisch
    on the street, then beat him on the head with his pistol, took him to a garage
    and shot him in the head. Chase tweice tried to direct FBI agents to the mine
    shaft where he said Frisch's body had been dumped, but it was not found. He was
    brought to New York to testify about the murder before a grand jury, but refused
    to repeat his story in court. Nelson was killed in a gun battle with the FBI on
    November 27, 1934. Graham and McKay were convicted of mail fraud in 1938 and sentenced
    to nine years in prison. Several years later they were pardoned and returned to
    Reno. They were never charged in Frisch's case. Authorities believe Frisch was
    murdered to prevent his testifying. His body has never been found. Investigating
