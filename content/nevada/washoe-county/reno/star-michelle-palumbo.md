  disappearance_details: Palumbo resided in Tucson, Arizona with her family until
    1999. She relocated to Reno, Nevada to live with her grandmother at that time.
    Palumbo was employed as a clerk in a pawn shop in 2000. She apparently became
    involved with drugs, namely methamphetamine, prior to her disappearance. According
    to her friends, Palumbo's income from her job in a local pawn shop no longer supported
    her drug usage. Authorities believe she may have turned to sex work in early 2000
    as a means of financial gain. Palumbo called her mother on April 25, 2000 and
    was paranoid during the conversation. Her mother said that Palumbo believed she
    was being followed and that her telephone was tapped. Palumbo's mother also said
    that her daughter mentioned the possibility of moving back to Arizona soon and
    wanted to make a new life for herself. An officer at Reno/Tahoe International
    Airport discovered Palumbo in a restricted area of the facility shortly after
    12:00 a.m. on April 26, 2000. Palumbo told the officer that she was searching
    for her sister, who she claimed had run out on to the tarmac. The officer stated
    that he believed Palumbo was hallucinating at the time. He did not believe her
    story, but he dropped Palumbo off at the entrance to the Reno Hilton Hotel and
    Casino at approximately 1:30 a.m. Palumbo was last seen near the entrance of the
    building by the valet parking area. She never checked in to the hotel and has
    not been heard from again. Her vehicle was discovered illegally parked and abandoned
    at the airport on April 27, one day after her disappearance. The majority of her
    personal belongings were found inside the car, along with her cellular phone and
    her purse, which contained $600 in cash. Palumbo left behind three emails addressed
    to the White House, stating she believed the federal government was attempting
    to murder her. A drawing of a woman fitting her description was also discovered
    in the vehicle, which depicted the female bound and gagged. Two books that specialized
    in changing identities were also found inside her car. The owner of the Silver
    Dollar Casino in Elko, Nevada claimed that Palumbo was inside her establishment
    in December 2000, eight months after Palumbo disappeared. The owner told authorities
    that the woman became nervous when she saw a man peering through the bar's window
    during the evening. According to the owner, the woman then departed from the Silver
    Dollar Casino with another female. Authorities have been unable to confirm if
    the unidentified woman in the establishment was indeed Palumbo. Foul play is suspected
    in her case. Investigating Agency Reno Police Department 775-334-2155 Source Information
