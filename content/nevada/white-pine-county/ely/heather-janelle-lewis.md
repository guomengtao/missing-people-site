    Nevada on April 4, 2003. Cigarettes were found in her possession and she was suspended
    from school as a result. She never returned home has never been heard from again.
    Authorities believe she left of her own accord. At the time of her disappearance,
    Heather was having problems with her stepmother and she missed her brother, who
    had moved to Oklahoma. None of her relatives, including her family in Oklahoma,
    has heard from her since she went missing. Heather's loved ones believe she may
    have come to harm after running away, as it is uncharacteristic of her to be out
    of touch with them for this long. Few details are available in her case. Investigating
