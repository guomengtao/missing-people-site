  disappearance_details: Angela was last seen on November 13, 1989 in her home on
    Shady Lake Parkway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Her husband, George "Joey" Smith,
    reported her missing three days later and told police she left home in her 1981
    Mercedes on the morning of November 14, after an argument with him the night before.
    He said she took two black and gray canvas suitcases with her. A week after Angela
    disappeared, George had all the carpeting in their home professionally cleaned.
    The carpet was less than four months old and the cleaner found only one stain,
    which was near the foot of the bed in the master bedroom. It was about six inches
    in diameter. George told the carpet cleaner that it was a coffee stain, but the
    cleaner said it came out more easily than coffee stains usually do. On November
    17, George found Angela's car in the long-term parking lot of the airport in New
    Orleans, Louisiana. There was a parking stub inside showing that the car had been
    parked there since November 13. Angela has never been heard from again. Members
    of Angela's family suspected George in her disappearance from the beginning, claiming
    he had previously threatened to kill her and hide the body where no one would
    ever find it. They stated that Angela had told them that if anything happened
    to her, her husband was probably responsible. Angela was George's third wife.
    In 1985, George's second wife, Sheila L. Smith, was found murdered in her home
    in St. Landry Parrish, Louisiana. In 1995, George was later convicted of her murder-for-hire.
    The actual killer was Albert Lavalais, a teenager who had worked as a farmhand
    for George. In 1987 in Lafayette, Louisiana, a woman who had been living with
    George was found shot to death in her apartment. Her death appeared to be a suicide,
    but police found it suspicious. No charges were ever filed in the woman's case.
    Angela was declared dead in 1993, and police seized the $500,000 life insurance
    police George had out on her. George died in prison in 2000; he was never charged
    in connection with Angela's disappearance, which remains unsolved. Investigating
