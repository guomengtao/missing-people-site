  disappearance_details: Kergan was last seen leaving the Night Spot Lounge on Plank
    Road in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on November 28, 1984. He was accompanied by Leila
    "Erika" Mulla, a teenage exotic dancer, at the time. Kergan was carrying $2,000
    in cash when he disappeared. He has never been heard from again. His late model
    pink Cadillac was later found abandoned in Metairie, Louisiana, with puddles of
    blood in the trunk. Authorities believe Mulla and her boyfriend, Ronald Delton
    Dunnagan, murdered Kergan. They fled the area for Las Vegas, Nevada after his
    disappearance. When authorities searched Mulla and Dunnagan's apartment in the
    2900 block of Byron Street, they found evidence of a violent struggle, including
    bloodstains. Entries in Mulla's diary indicated she was planning to murder Kergan.
    Mulla and and Dunnagan were arrested and charged with murder , and when questioned
    by police after her arrest, Mulla implicated Dunnagan in the the crime. However,
    both defendants were released three months after their arrest and the charges
    were dropped. Mulla refused to testify against Dunnagan, and Kergan's body could
    not be found even after one of the most extensive searches in Baton Rouge history.
    Prosecutors did not believe they had enough evidence to convict Mulla and Dunnagan
    of murder. The case was reopened more than twenty-five years later and, in December
    2012, Mulla and Dunnagan were re-arrested for Kergan's murder. Authorities stated
    DNA typing was able to prove it was Kergan's blood inside the apartment, which
    gave them the proof they needed. Photos of the defendants are posted with this
    case summary. Dunnagan was living in Bossier City, Louisiana at the time of his
    second murder arrest; Mulla was in in New York City. He was charged with first-degree
    murder and she with second-degree murder; both of them were also charged with
    simple robbery and conspiracy. The grand jury didn't indict Dunnagan, however,
    and he was released. Mulla pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the spring of 2014
    and agreed to cooperate in the case against Dunnagan, and with the additional
    evidence he was indicted. Mulla stated they poisoned Kergan's wine, and then Dunnagan
    smothered him. She testified against Dunnagan at his trial in 2015 and he was
    convicted of second-degree murder, which in Louisiana carries a sentence of life
    in prison. Kergan and his brother co-owned a chain of Sonic drive-in restaurants
    in southern Louisiana in 1984. He was married and has a son. Kergan was declared
    legally dead in 1986. He has never been located, but foul play is suspected in
    his case due to the circumstances involved. Investigating Agency Baton Rouge City
