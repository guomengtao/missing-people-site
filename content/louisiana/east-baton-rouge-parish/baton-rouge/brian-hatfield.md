  disappearance_details: Hatfield was last seen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana during the
    morning of May 9, 2004. He had been in Lafayette, Louisiana and was returning
    home to Baton Rouge that day. He dropped two friends off in different places,
    the last one in the 3800 block of Geronimo Street in Baton Rouge. He never arrived
    at his own home and has never been heard from again. His White 2000 Chevrolet
    Cavalier was found three weeks later, on May 21, in the parking lot of a Chevron
    gas station in Baton Rouge. Its license plate was missing and there was no sign
    of Hatfield or any struggle at the scene. Hatfield's checks and check card have
    been used since his disappearance, and investigators pulled over an individual
    who had Hatfield's license plate on his car. Authorities say these indicate that
    foul play was involved in Hatfield's disappearance. They are not ruling anything
    out, however. Hatfield was the manager of a Racetrac gas station on O'Neil Lane
    at the time of his disappearance. He was planning to move to Atlanta, Georgia
    before he vanished. His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Baton Rouge
