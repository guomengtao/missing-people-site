  disappearance_details: 'Latiolais was last seen on the Interstate 10 bridge over
    the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on August 29, 2014. He was sitting
    along the bridge rail next to his pickup truck. Someone spoke to him at 2:00 a.m.
    and he said he was en route to West Baton Rouge, but it never arrived there. During
    the early morning hours, police got an anonymous call saying someone had jumped
    from the bridge, 175 feet to the river below. They searched the river, but couldn''t
    find a body; they only found Latiolais''s truck, still running. His cellular phone
    and cigarettes were there, as was a trolling motor he''d just bought, but his
    wallet and crutches were missing. He has never been heard from again. When Latiolais''s
    mother checked his apartment, she found indications of a struggle: there were
    holes in the walls and a window was punched out. Many of Latiolais''s belongings,
    including his TV set and guns, were missing. His crutches were never recovered.
    Latiolais''s mother believes her son met with foul play and someone tried to make
    his disappearance look like a suicide. Latiolais enjoyed fishing, working on cars
    and drawing prior to his disappearance, and had occasionally been hired to draw
    things on the walls of homes and businesses. He left behind a young daughter.
    His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Baton Rouge Police Department
