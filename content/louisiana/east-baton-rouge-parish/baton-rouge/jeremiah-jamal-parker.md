  disappearance_details: Parker was last seen with a cousin at approximately 6:00
    p.m. on April 11, 2004, at the North Sherwood Forest Park in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
    He left his car, a red 1993 Pontiac Grand Am, behind the treeline in the northwest
    corner of the park and left his cousin inside the vehicle while he went into the
    park. He said he wanted to look for a cellular phone holder which he had lost.
    Parker never returned. A search for him uncovered only his cellular phone and
    one of his shoes about fifty yards from where his car was parked. Parker's loved
    ones are puzzled by his disappearance; he has not gone missing before and never
    even spent the night away from home without telling his parents. He worked at
    Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers and attended Baton Rouge Community College at
    the time of his disappearance. He had seen the movie The Passion of the Christ
    shortly before his disappearance and was deeply moved by it. After watching the
    film, he told his family members he would be "leaving soon." It is unclear what
    Parker meant by this statement or whether the film had anything to do with his
    disappearance. Parker's case remains unsolved. He may have traveled to Canada
    after he was last seen. Investigating Agency Baton Rouge Police Department 225-389-2000
