  disappearance_details: Mebruer went to the local video store near her home in Zachary,
    Louisiana on April 18, 1998. She and her young son returned to their residence
    on Saul Avenue at approximately 7:00 p.m. Mebruer has never been seen again. Her
    son walked to a neighbor's home the following morning and said that his mother
    was missing. The adults entered the Mebruers' residence and discovered blood on
    the floor; they then called the authorities. Evidence inside Mebruer's house indicated
    signs of a struggle and foul play. There was a pink plastic bag in her carport,
    which was stained with her blood. Investigators believe that Mebruer was assaulted
    inside her residence and murdered; they believe her body was taken elsewhere.
    She was employed as a home health nurse in 1998. Mebruer's ex-husband was originally
    a suspect in her disappearance but has since been ruled out. There was a break
    in Mebruer's case in February 2004, when DNA testing linked suspected serial killer
    Derrick Todd Lee to her presumed murder. A photograph of Lee is posted with this
    case summary. He is known as the Baton Rouge Serial Killer. A former resident
    of West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, he has been charged with six other murders,
    attempted murder, and rape. His suspected victims were all White women living
    in southern Louisiana. Lee is awaiting trial for all the murders. He is also considered
    a possible suspect in the disappearances of Mari Fowler, Melinda McGhee and Glenn
    Tankersley. Mebruer has never been located. Police continue to search for her
    remains. Investigating Agency Zachary Police Department 225-654-9393 Source Information
