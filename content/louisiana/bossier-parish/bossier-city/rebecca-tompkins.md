  disappearance_details: Rebecca was last seen with her mother, Desiree Tompkins,
    in Bossier City, Louisiana on November 20, 1983. Royal R. "Dick" Tompkins Jr.,
    who is Rebecca's father and Desiree's husband, reported the two missing on November
    25. Photos of Royal and Desiree are posted with this case summary. The family
    lived in the 3300 block of east Texas Street. On December 3, Desiree's nude body
    was found by hunters in a ditch on Rice Road near Greenwood, Louisiana. She had
    been stabbed to death. There was no indication of Rebecca's whereabouts and she
    has never been heard from again. Royal was subequently arrested and charged with
    first-degree murder in the deaths of both his wife and his daughter. According
    to his confession, Royal and Desiree were arguing on the evening of November 20,
    and when Rebecca interrupted them with her crying, he flew into a rage and strangled
    the baby. When Desiree tried to defend her daughter by knocking Royal onto the
    ground next to his fishing equipment, he grabbed a fishing knife and stabbed her
    to death. He said he wrapped Rebecca's body in a blanket and put it in garbage
    bag, then put the bag in a dumpster. Royal initially pleaded not guilty by reason
    of insanity. In March 1984, in order to avoid a possible death sentence, he pleaded
    guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced to two terms of
    life in prison without the possibility of parole. In June of that year, however,
    Royal recanted his confession and said Rebecca was still alive. He said that prior
    to Desiree's murder, he had told her to get the baby from the babysitter, and
    she said she couldn't because Rebecca "wasn't ours anymore." He said he didn't
    know his daughter's current whereabouts and he only claimed he strangled her because
    the police didn't believe him when he said he didn't know where she was. Authorities
    searched a landfill in Caddo Parish, Louisiana for two weeks, trying to find the
    baby's body, but it was never located. Foul play is suspected in her case due
    to the circumstances involved. Investigating Agency Bossier City Police Department
