  disappearance_details: Penelope was separated from her husband, Akhim "Eddie" Madanat,
    in October 1991. She resided in Bossier City, Louisiana with the couple's two
    young children. Penelope recently earned her cosmetology license and was employed
    at Pro Cuts on Airline Drive at the time. She planned to celebrate her first paycheck
    at Cowboys nightclub with her sister during the evening of October 26, 1991. However,
    Penelope's daughter became sick later in the night, and her sister cared for her
    while Penelope went to the club by herself. Witnesses at Cowboys told authorities
    that Penelope and Eddie were seen arguing inside the building that night. Eddie
    told investigators that Penelope was intoxicated and he offered to drive her home
    in his black Honda Prelude. Eddie said that they continued the argument inside
    the vehicle and she demanded to exit the car. He claimed that Penelope began walking
    down Gould Drive in Bossier City as he drove himself home. A clerk at a nearby
    restaurant told authorities that Penelope entered the business late that night.
    She asked for change to place a call from a pay telephone. The clerk said that
    a dark-colored vehicle was parked outside the restaurant during this time. Penelope
    has never been heard from again. Eddie failed two polygraph exams shortly after
    his estranged wife disappeared. Authorities have said they believe he knows what
    happened to Penelope and that he is a possible suspect in her case. Eddie took
    their two children to Jordan some time after Penelope was last seen. The United
    States does not have an extradition treaty with Jordan and Eddie cannot be forced
    to return to Louisiana to answer more questions from law enforcement. No charges
    have been filed in Penelope's case, but foul play is suspected. Penelope's case
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Bossier City Police Department 318-741-8611
