  disappearance_details: McCullough was last seen in Many, Louisiana on August 7,
    2015. He left his residence, driving his Mitsubishi Montero Sport with the Louisiana
    license plate number RRA831 and a faded sticker in the back window saying "In
    Memory of Josh Miller". A photo of the Mitsubishi is posted with this case summary.
    McCullough said he was going out to look for work. He never returned and has never
    been heard from again. After his disappearance, his vehicle was found abandoned
    in a wooded area. At the time of his disappearance, McCullough was awaiting the
    completion of a bench trial; it had been delayed from July 31 to August 26 to
    allow a witness to testify. He'd been charged with aggravated second-degree battery
    in August 2014 after he allegedly severely beat a man in the bathroom of a bar
    on State Highway 6. The victim suffered multiple head and facial injuries, was
    initially comatose and required hospital treatment and rehabilitation. McCullough
    has an extensive criminal record, with 35 arrests dating back to 1994 for crimes
    including drug possession, theft, three counts of driving while intoxicated, and
    issuing worthless checks. He could be sentenced to up to fifteen years in prison
    if convicted of aggravated second-degree battery, and because he was on felony
    probation at the time of his arrest, he could have his sentence enhanced under
    the state's habitual offender laws. After his disappearance, an arrest warrant
    was issued for him after he missed a court appearance. A witness told police that
    McCullough had been abducted by two people and taken to a logging area in the
    Sabine National Forrest in Sabine County, Texas. The witness said he was shot
    to death and set on fire. Police went to the logging site and a cadaver dog indicated
    the presence of human remains at the exact spot where the witness said McCullough
    had been killed, but a search of the area turned up no evidence. Nevertheless,
    authorities believe the witness's account is credible and they are still trying
    to verify it. It isn't clear whether McCullough is running from the law, but police
    and his family are anxious to find him. His case remains unsolved. Investigating
