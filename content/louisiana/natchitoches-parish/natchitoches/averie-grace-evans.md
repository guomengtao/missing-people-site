  disappearance_details: Averie was selling candy door-to-door on November 5, 1990
    in Natchitoches, Louisiana. She had visited a friend and was on her way home at
    the time of her disappearance. She was attempting to earn money for a school fundraiser
    at the time. She was last seen in the area of Fifth and Stephens Streets. She
    has never been heard from again. Her White, pink and purple Murray bicycle disappeared
    with her. Phillip Louis DeSelle was one of Averie's neighbors in 1991 and had
    previously purchased candy from her. He was considered a suspect in her case from
    early on in the investigation, but the police did not have any evidence against
    him until January 1991, when DeSelle sent an anonymous letter to authorities confessing
    to strangling Averie. The note said he disposed of her body in a trash bin and
    put her bicycle in Sibley Lake. In his letter, DeSelle apologized for his actions
    and described some of the clothing and jewelry Averie wore on the day of her disappearance.
    After it was discovered that he was the letter's author, DeSelle attempted to
    commit suicide by slashing his wrists, but survived. He was subsequently charged
    with first-degree murder. Averie's bicycle was located where he said it would
    be, but her remains were not recovered in spite of an extensive search of the
    local landfill. DeSelle pleaded guilty to manslaughter and aggravated kidnapping
    in connection with Averie's case, and was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Prosecutors
    agreed to the plea bargain because, without the child's body, they did not believe
    they could prove a case of premeditated murder. Photos of DeSelle are posted with
    this case summary. He was released from prison in January 2015, but will remain
    on parole until 2040 and is registered as a sex offender. Averie was a straight-A
    student at the time of her disappearance, and was noted as a talented violinist.
    has never been located, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances
    involved. Investigating Agency Natchitoches Police Department 318-352-8101 Source
