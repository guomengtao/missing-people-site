  disappearance_details: Fell was last seen in Marrero, Louisiana on June 10, 2011.
    He was driving his car on River Road between Marrero Road and Klein Road when
    he lost control of the vehicle, flipped it and landed in a small ditch. Fell was
    able to climb out the passenger window and he answered a cellular phone call from
    his brother shortly thereafter. During the conversation he sounded alert and coherent.
    His brother and the police arrived at the scene of the accident within twenty
    minutes, but by then Fell was gone, leaving one of his shoes behind. He has never
    been heard from again. Fell studied jewelry and metalwork at the University of
    Louisiana at Lafayette. He lived in Harvey, Louisiana and was employed as a senior
    technical advisor for VeriFone at the time of his disappearance. His family believes
    he might have suffered memory loss and tried to return to the Savannah, Georgia
    area, where he had lived for several years before coming back to his home state
    of Louisiana. The circumstances of his disappearance are unclear. Investigating
