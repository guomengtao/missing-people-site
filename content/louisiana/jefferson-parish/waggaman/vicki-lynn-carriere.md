  disappearance_details: Carriere was last seen in her hometown of Waggaman, Louisiana
    on July 12, 1987 at approximately 5:00 p.m. She was with her boyfriend, Joseph
    Phillips, at the Time Saver convenience store in the 8600 block of River Road
    at that time. He was the father of her unborn child and they were engaged. The
    couple had gone to stay at Phillips's family's fishing camp, and afterwards Phillips
    was supposed to take her to her parents' home in the 300 block of Azalea Drive.
    They stopped at the convenience store to pick up drinks, and he went into the
    store while she waited outside in the car. When he came back, Carriere was gone
    and so was a bundle of her clothing. She has not been seen again. Carriere's family
    was concerned when she didn't return from her trip to the fishing camp, and became
    alarmed when she missed her baby shower a week later. Her parents were looking
    forward to the birth of their grandson and had already purchased baby items and
    paid the hospital delivery bill in advance of the planned birth. Phillips is considered
    a suspect in Carriere's disappearance and he refused to take a polygraph test.
    He was never charged in her case, however, and he died in 2002 at the age of 47.
    Carriere's disappearance remains unsolved. She worked as a clerk at the Avondale
    Marine Shipyard in 1987. Investigating Agency Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office
