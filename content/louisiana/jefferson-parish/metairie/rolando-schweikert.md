  disappearance_details: Schweikert disappeared from Hearst Street in Metairie, Louisiana
    on April 29, 1991. He has never been heard from again. His roommate, Manuel Ortiz,
    reported him missing on May 1. That same day, Schweikert was sighted at his bank,
    Metairie Bank. The witnesses who recognized him said he appeared to be "dazed"
    and possibly under the influence of drugs. Ortiz is currently serving a life sentence
    for the unrelated murders of two women, but there's no evidence that he was involved
    in Schweikert's case. Schweikert is originally from Guatemala. His life was insured
    for $1 million at the time of his disappearance, and when he was declared dead
    in 1999, his mother in Guatemala collected on the policy. Authorities received
    a tip that Schweikert is alive and well in Guatemala and disappeared intentionally
    in an insurance fraud scheme. This information was never verified, however, and
    his case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office
