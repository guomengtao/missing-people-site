  disappearance_details: Sylvester was last seen at a home in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana
    on September 22, 2017. She may have been sighted in a White truck near Breaux
    Bridge on October 2, but this sighting has not been confirmed. She has never been
    heard from again. Her purse and cellular phone were left behind, and the food
    she'd made for dinner was left on the stove. She didn't pick up her last paycheck
    from her job at a casino, and also missed her daughter's prom, which is uncharacteristic
    of her behavior. She had been looking forward to the prom and had already picked
    the hairstyle she wanted her daughter to have for the event. According to her
    family, prior to her disappearance Sylvester had seemed "confident and happy",
    and she kept in daily touch with her family and often visited her father. Only
    days after her disappearance, her landlord moved her belongings and the trailer
    in which she lived, something her family believes led to possible evidence being
    lost or destroyed. Foul play is possible in her case, which remains unsolved.
