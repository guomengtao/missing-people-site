  disappearance_details: Gonzales was last seen in Rayne, Louisiana on April 7, 1992
    at 3:00 p.m., walking along South Adams Street near Devil's Alley. She was selling
    insurance policies to businesses in the area. She had just started her job and
    it was her first day without her boss accompanying her. Gonzales's blue 1982 Pontiac
    Bonneville was found in a parking lot off of Devil's Alley near South Adams Street.
    Her purse and driver's license were in the trunk, but the car keys were missing,
    as well as her brown work briefcase. Three people reported seeing her the day
    after her reported disappearance. Investigators believe Gonzales met with foul
    play, as it is uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. She had spent
    several years with the Trappist nuns in Iowa and had contemplated joining the
    order. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Rayne Police Department
