    on a small aluminum boat approximately 75 yards from the Red River boat launch
    in Coushatta, Louisiana when the boat capsized. Four of the six passengers made
    it to shore, but Hannah and another passenger, 25-year-old David Loftin Jr., went
    missing after the accident. An extensive search of the river turned up no sign
    of Hannah or Loftin, and a memorial service for them was planned. Hours before
    the service was conducted, Loftin's body was recovered from the Red River not
    far from where the boat capsized. Hannah's body has never been located, however.
