  disappearance_details: 'O''Pry needed to run errands on July 19, 1996 in her hometown
    of Shreveport, Louisiana. Eric Dale Mickelson, a friend of her boyfriend, agreed
    to drive O''Pry if she paid for his gasoline costs. Mickelson and O''Pry were
    riding in his White 1971 Chevrolet Fleetside pickup truck. Photos of Mickelson
    and his vehicle are posted with this case summary. O''Pry and Mickelson visited
    her sister''s residence on Meriweather Road and departed at approximately 8:00
    p.m. Mickelson told authorities that he and O''Pry stopped at the Circle K store
    on the corner of Walker Road and Mackey Lane. Mickelson stated that O''Pry used
    the pay phone at the store. Phone records did not show any indication of any calls
    O''Pry may have made from the location. Mickelson claimed that he did not witness
    O''Pry make a call from the phone; he said that he was repairing his vehicle''s
    stereo speaker wires at the time she was inside the business. Mickelson stated
    that he proceeded to drop O''Pry off at the El Chico entrance of the South Park
    Mall on Jewella Avenue in Shreveport at approximately 8:30 p.m. O''Pry has never
    been seen again. She was reported missing four days after she was last seen. O''Pry''s
    boyfriend of six years, Jerry "Todd" Dean, told investigators that Mickelson called
    him between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. on July 20, 1996, the day following O''Pry''s
    disappearance. Dean said that Mickelson told him he dropped O''Pry at the mall
    the previous evening. O''Pry lived with Dean and his friend, Wade Burnley, on
    Linwood Avenue at the time she was last seen. Dean did not inform O''Pry''s family
    that she never returned home until July 23, four days after she initially disappeared.
    He stated he and O''Pry had a troubled relationship with frequent fights. O''Pry
    did not take any personal belongings with her when she vanished. She also left
    behind her three-year-old daughter, something that her family said was completely
    uncharacteristic of her behavior. Security guards at the South Park Mall told
    investigators that they did not observe anyone matching O''Pry''s description
    at the shopping center the night she was last seen. Authorities are not certain
    if she arrived at the location. Both Dean and Burnley passed polygraph tests administered
    by law enforcement shortly after O''Pry''s disappearance. Mickelson refused to
    take a lie detector test, saying that he considers the devices unreliable. He
    was considered the prime suspect in O''Pry''s case, although for many years he
    maintained his innocence. He and his girlfriend, Susane "Beverly" Arthur, were
    charged with the unrelated murder of an elderly Shreveport man, Charles Martin,
    in 2007. While in prison awaiting trial on that charge, Mickelson confessed to
    O''Pry''s murder. He said he had strangled her, dumped her body in a pond, then
    came back later, removed it, dismembered it and put the parts in a culvert and
    various area dumpsters. Some months later, in August 2007, he was charged with
    second-degree murder in O''Pry''s case. Authorities stated they found unspecified
    evidence in the pond that corroborated his confession, but her body has not been
    located. Some law enforcement officers consider Mickelson to be a serial killer.
    There were unconfirmed reports that he admitted to involvement in four other homicides,
    but he has not been charged with any murders besides Martin''s and O''Pry''s.
    Mickelson was convicted of Martin''s murder in August 2011 and sentenced to death,
    but his conviction was overturned. In 2015, after a re-trial in Martin''s case,
    he was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. He is still awaiting trial
    for O''Pry''s murder. Extensive searches have not yielded any clues as to O''Pry''s
    whereabouts. Foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved in O''Pry''s
    disappearance. Investigating Agency Caddo Parish Sheriff''s Office 318-929-7977

## Case Details
O'Pry needed to run errands on July 19, 1996 in her hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Eric Dale Mickelson, a friend of her boyfriend, agreed to drive O'Pry if she paid for his gasoline costs. Mickelson and O'Pry were riding in his White 1971 Chevrolet Fleetside pickup truck. Photos of Mickelson and his vehicle are posted with this case summary.
