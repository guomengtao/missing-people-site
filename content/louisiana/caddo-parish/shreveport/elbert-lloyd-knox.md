  disappearance_details: Knox was last seen walking down Kemp Lane, less than half
    a mile from his home in the 2600 block of Circle Drive, in Shreveport, Louisiana
    on June 21, 2013. He has never been heard from again. After his disappearance,
    a family member found one of his shoes in the backyard of his home, at the edge
    of the lawn where the woods began. Police dogs tracked Knox's scent for some distance,
    but then lost the trail by the roadside, suggesting he got into a vehicle. An
    extensive search of the area turned up no other sign of him. It's uncharacteristic
    of Knox to leave without warning and his family doesn't believe he would have
    gotten into a stranger's car voluntarily. His case remains unsolved. Investigating
