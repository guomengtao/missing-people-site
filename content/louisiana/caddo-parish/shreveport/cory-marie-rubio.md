  disappearance_details: 'Rubio called her mother and said she would be returning
    to her family''s residence after picking up her two daughters from their babysitter''s
    home in Shreveport, Louisiana on January 27, 1999. She never arrived at the sitter''s
    house and has never been heard from again. Rubio had spent part of the day at
    Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. She was discussing a child
    support hearing scheduled for the following day with her former husband, Jesse
    McGay. McGay was a Senior Airman in the United States Air Force at the time; he
    and Rubio had divorced the previous summer. He paid child support for their two-year-old
    daughter and wanted the amount reduced. He and Rubio were also in the middle of
    a custody battle. Security records indicate that Rubio arrived on base on January
    27, but outgoing visitors'' logs are not recorded. It is not known if Rubio departed
    from the facility. Her family has said that it is extremely uncharacteristic of
    her to leave without alerting her loved ones as to her plans. Rubio''s White 1994
    Ford Probe was discovered abandoned at the Stoner Avenue boat ramp on the Red
    River in Shreveport shortly after she disappeared. The ramp is located across
    the river from the base. There was no sign of Rubio at the scene, but her purse
    and shoes were inside the vehicle, which had been ransacked. McGay was transferred
    to Osan Air Force Base in Korea sometime after his former wife vanished. He fled
    from Korea shortly after his transfer and left a letter behind stating that he
    had "unfinished business" to deal with in the United States and was tired of his
    life. McGay was apprehended in Dallas, Texas in November 1999, ten months after
    Rubio disappeared. He reportedly had a history of violent behavior towards Rubio
    and others. He has never been charged in connection with her case. Rubio''s parents
    sought sole custody of her and McGay''s daughter, and after McGay failed to attend
    a trial concerning the matter, her parents were given custody and he had to pay
    support to them. Authorities spent three days searching for Rubio''s remains in
    an area near the boat ramp in Shreveport in March 2001. Investigators believed
    they located a possible section of interest at the site, but conditions did not
    allow further excavation at the time. Because of his violent history, McGay was
    considered a person of interest in her case, but there was no evidence to implicate
    him. Rubio''s case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected in her disappearance.

## Case Details
Rubio called her mother and said she would be returning to her family's residence after picking up her two daughters from their babysitter's home in Shreveport, Louisiana on January 27, 1999. She never arrived at the sitter's house and has never been heard from again. Rubio had spent part of the day at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. She was discussing a child support hearing scheduled for the following day with her former husband, Jesse McGay. McGay was a Senior Airman in the United States Air Force at the time; he and Rubio had divorced the previous summer. He paid child support for their two-year-old daughter and wanted the amount reduced. He and Rubio were also in the middle of a custody battle. Security records indicate that Rubio arrived on base on January 27, but outgoing visitors' logs are not recorded. It is not known if Rubio departed from the facility. Her family has said that it is extremely uncharacteristic of her to leave without alerting her loved ones as to her plans. Rubio's White 1994 Ford Probe was discovered abandoned at the Stoner Avenue boat ramp on the Red River in Shreveport shortly after she disappeared. The ramp is located across the river from the base. There was no sign of Rubio at the scene, but her purse and shoes were inside the vehicle, which had been ransacked. McGay was transferred to Osan Air Force Base in Korea sometime after his former wife vanished.
