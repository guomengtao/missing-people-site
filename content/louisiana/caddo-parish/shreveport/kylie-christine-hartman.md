  disappearance_details: Hartman was last seen in Shreveport, Louisiana on September
    10, 2018. She was with her ex-boyfriend and was last seen leaving the Break n'
    Run, a bar on Mansfield Road, with him. She has never been heard from again. Another
    woman, Crystal Beal, disappeared from Caddo Parish, Louisiana a month earlier,
    on either August 6 or August 8. Both she and Hartman are from Shreveport, have
    criminal histories and ran in the same same social circles. In spite of this,
    police have found no evidence that the women knew each other or that their disappearances
    are related. Hartman did know Zachary Hebert, a 37-year-old Shreveport man who
    disappeared in September 2018; his body was found in a shallow grave in pasture
    in Benson, Louisiana on October 31 that year. The cause of death could not be
    determined due to decomposition of the remains. Investigators haven't said whether
    Hebert's murder is related to Hartman's disappearance. Hartman's family believes
    she is dead, as previously she had never gone for more than a few weeks without
    contacting her loved ones. The circumstances of her disappearance are unclear
    and her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Shreveport Police Department
