  disappearance_details: Yates-McCathran was last seen at her home in the 10000 block
    Vivian Airport Road in Vivian, Louisiana on January 21, 2020. She spoke to a friend
    on the phone that day, upset and crying, and said she and her husband of seven
    years had been fighting and she needed to get away. She said she wanted to take
    a restaurant job that her friend had offered her. During the conversation, someone
    walked in, and although Yates-McCathran had been crying she said hello to that
    person in a normal tone of voice. Her husband arrived home to find her gone. There
    was okra cooking on the stove, and Yates-McCathran's purse and driver's license
    were left behind. She has never been heard from again. At the time of her disappearance,
    her vehicle was disabled; authorities believe she either walked away from home
    or got picked up by someone else. Yates-McCathran's parents in Shreveport, Louisiana
    have custody of her two children. On the day she went missing, she spoke to her
    daughter on the phone; she was upset about not being able to see the child on

    party the following week. A search of the couple's five-acre property turned up
    her jewelry, hat and scarf in the woods, but no other sign of her. In April 2020,
    three months after Yates-McCathran disappeared, a person left unspecified information
    about her at an undisclosed business in Vivian. Authorities have appealed for
    this individual to come forward so they can speak with the person further. Yates-McCathran's
