  disappearance_details: Winslow was last seen in Oil City, Louisiana on January 23,
    2011. She had been out with friends the night before, but returned to Oil City
    at around midnight. Her boyfriend spoke to her on the phone around that time.
    Witnesses heard her talking outside the apartment she shared with her mother in
    the 100 block of north Dickey Street, then the sound of a car driving away. She
    has never been heard from again. At 2:30 a.m., Winslow's silver 2006 Dodge Charger
    was found abandoned and burned on the roadside near North Lakeshore and Kuhn's
    Road. The vehicle had been completely destroyed. Several days after her disappearance,
    Eddie Lee "Biscuit" Jackson was charged with second-degree kidnapping and arson
    in Winslow's case. He and Winslow had lived together for fifteen years and he's
    the father of her three children, but they had ended their relationship two months
    before Winslow went missing. A photograph of Jackson is posted with this case
    summary. Authorities believe he abducted Winslow from outside her apartment building
    and then set her car on fire. Cellular phone records placed Jackson in the vicinity
    of the burning vehicle. Winslow and Jackson's two oldest children testified against
    him at his trial in the summer of 2012. They had seen their father beat their
    mother with a gun and threaten to kill her; that incident precipitated the couple's
    break-up. One of Winslow's cousins testified that Jackson had sent Winslow threatening
    text messages and she'd gotten a gun to protect herself. Jackson maintained his
    innocence, but he was convicted of all counts in August 2012. The jury deliberated
    less than two hours before reaching a verdict. He was sentenced to forty years
    in prison without the possibility of parole. Winslow's body has never been located,
    but foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.
