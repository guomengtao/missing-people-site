  disappearance_details: Vernier was last seen in Merryville, Louisiana on August
    28, 2007. He had traveled to Houston, Texas with two friends. While they were
    on their way back, they crashed their car into a telephone pole on La. 389 and
    Monroe Whitman Road, south of Merryville. Vernier's friends stated he walked away
    from the scene of the crash. He has never been heard from again. Investigators
    found tracks near the Sabine River leading back up a highline along La. 389, and
    near a slough. They searched in two-mile radius around the crash site, but found
    no sign of Vernier besides the tracks. Although he is a knowledgeable woodsman,
    due to the state of his health Vernier could not have survived outdoors for very
    long. Foul play isn't suspected in his case, but he is presumed to be deceased.
