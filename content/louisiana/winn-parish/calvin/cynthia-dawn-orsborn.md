  disappearance_details: Cynthia was last seen in Calvin, Louisiana on June 13, 2017.
    She and her boyfriend, Jack Daniel "J.D." Nobles, rented a house in the 400 block
    of Front Avenue. He told authorities she simply got into a car and rode off. She
    has never been heard from again. A photo of Nobles is posted with this case summary.
    There was a history of domestic violence in the couple's relationship, and after
    a domestic disturbance in November 2016, Cynthia filed an order of protection
    against him. Ten days after her disappearance, he was arrested and charged with
    violating it. Nobles is the only person of interest in Cynthia's case. He has
    a criminal history dating back to 1997, with many of the offenses involving violence
    against women. He had been charged with rape, assault and false imprisonment in
    2014 after he allegedly attacked another girlfriend, but the charges were dropped
    after the victim dropped out of sight before trial. Authorities have since located
    her and hope to bring the rape case to trial. Cynthia's father, Michael Orsborn,
    disappeared from Provencal, Louisiana in 2006, eleven years before Cynthia did,
    and has never been found. There is no indication that the two disappearances are
    related. She left behind two children. Foul play is suspected in her case, which
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office 318-352-6432
