  disappearance_details: Journee was last seen in thw 1600 block of Mandeville Street
    in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 22, 2021. She said she was going to see
    Fredo Bang, a rapper, perform at the Saenger Theatre in New Orleans that evening,
    and that her ex-boyfriend, Roosevelt Marshall, was coming with her. She left home
    and got into Marshall's vehicle, a black Toyota Avalon with the Louisiana license
    plate number 102EQM; a photo of a similar car is posted with this case summary.
    It's unclear whether Journee actually arrived at the concert. She has never been
    heard from again. A photo of Marshall is posted with this case summary; he's considered
    a person of interest in Journee's disappearance. He and Journee were together
    on and off for several years prior to her disappearance, but were no longer together
    by the time she went missing. In August 2020, over a year prior to Journee's disappearance,
    he was charged with unauthorized use of movables and aggravated assault after
    he allegedly took her keys and drove their rental car away, with her holding onto
    the steering wheel. In December of that year, he was charged with domestic battery
    after he allegedly punched her several times, severely bruising her face and ripping
    out an earring. At the time, Journee told police there was a long history of domestic
    violence between her and Marshall, with verbal and physical abuse happening daily,
    and that he had threatened to kill her. Marshall dropped out of sight after Journee
    went missing, and Journee's family hired a private investigator four months later
    who found him in Cobb County, Georgia. In August 2022, he was arrested on the
    aforementioned 2020 charges and extradited to New Orleans, but the charges were
    then dropped. He has never been charged in Journee's disappearance, or interviewed
    about it by the New Orleans police, although the police in Georgia did question
    him about her. Journee's family believes she met with foul play, as it's uncharacteristic
    of her to leave without warning or to abandon her three children. Her case remains
    unsolved. Investigating Agency New Orleans Police Department 504-658-6050 Source
