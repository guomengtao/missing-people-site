  disappearance_details: Eriel was last seen at the Children's Hospital &amp; Care
    Center in New Orleans, Louisiana on July 30, 2019. She has never been heard from
    again. She may have had contact with someone in May 2020, but authorities were
    unable to verify this and the person who allegedly last saw her is now deceased.
    A relative of Eriel's who lived in New Orleans was granted guardianship of her
    by the Washoe County Family Court in Reno, Nevada in 2018. The relative was instructed
    to file guardianship paperwork in Louisiana, but never did, and eventually stopped
    responding to court officials' requests. In November 2021, the Washoe County Family
    Court hired a private investigator to look into the matter and find Eriel. Her
    guardian, and other members of her biological family, were interviewed, but all
    of them said they did not know her whereabouts. She was officially reported missing
    on December 9 that year. The circumstances of Eriel's disappearance are unclear.
    The woman who applied to be her guardian may have died in 2020. Authorities will
    continue to search for Eriel until they've verified her location and well-being.
