  disappearance_details: Eiffert was last seen in New Orleans, Louisiana on January
    9, 2003. She had gone to pick up baby furniture from Nicole Johnson, a woman she
    met at the doctor's office during a prenatal visit. Johnson had recently lost
    a child and offered to give Eiffert her baby furniture. According to Johnson,
    Eiffert was last seen in the 4500 block of Demontluzin Street, near Franklin Avenue.
    She had tried to leave Johnson's home with the furniture, but her 1992 Ford Mustang
    didn't start, so she called her boyfriend for help, and Johnson saw Eiffert arguing
    with him on her cellular phone. Johnson said Eiffert walked across the street
    to a gas station and was never seen again. It took months for Eiffert's parents,
    who lived in Harahan, Louisiana, to recover their daughter's car. When reporters
    later tried to identify the location where Eiffert was last seen, they discovered
    there is no 4500 block of Demontluzin Street. Police are trying to identify and
    track down Johnson, as well as Eiffert's boyfriend, Jose or Joseph Lewis Hill,
    to interview them about the case. Eiffert's parents remain hopeful she is still
    alive. Her father in Harahan has kept the same phone number in case she tries
    to contact him. Texas authorities are assisting with the investigation. Investigating

## Case Details
Eiffert was last seen in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 9, 2003. She had gone to pick up baby furniture from Nicole Johnson, a woman she met at the doctor's office during a prenatal visit. Johnson had recently lost a child and offered to give Eiffert her baby furniture. According to Johnson, Eiffert was last seen in the 4500 block of Demontluzin Street, near Franklin Avenue. She had tried to leave Johnson's home with the furniture, but her 1992 Ford Mustang didn't start, so she called her boyfriend for help, and Johnson saw Eiffert arguing with him on her cellular phone. Johnson said Eiffert walked across the street to a gas station and was never seen again. It took months for Eiffert's parents, who lived in Harahan, Louisiana, to recover their daughter's car. When reporters later tried to identify the location where Eiffert was last seen, they discovered there is no 4500 block of Demontluzin Street. Police are trying to identify and track down Johnson, as well as Eiffert's boyfriend, Jose or Joseph Lewis Hill, to interview them about the case. Eiffert's parents remain hopeful she is still alive. Her father in Harahan has kept the same phone number in case she tries to contact him. Texas authorities are assisting with the investigation.
