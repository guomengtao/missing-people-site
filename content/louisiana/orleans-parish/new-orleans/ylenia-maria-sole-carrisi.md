  disappearance_details: 'Carrisi was touring Central America and North America when
    she arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1993. She had gone with her parents on
    a trip to the city then decided to stay after the vacation was over and her parents
    returned to Italy. At first she traveled to Florida, left a few days later, after
    telling her parents she feared two men in Florida were trying to drug and kill
    her. She traveled to Belize and Mexico before going back to New Orleans. Carrisi,
    who speaks fluent English, immersed herself in the street culture there and kept
    company with street musicians and homeless people. She painted and took notes
    about the people she met, stating she planned to write a book, possibly a novel,
    about her experiences. Her father believes she may have been using drugs during
    this period. At the time of her disappearance, Carrisi was staying in the LeDale,
    a cheap hotel in the 700 block of St. Charles Avenue, five blocks from the French
    Quarter, with 54-year-old Alexander Masakela (often spelled "Maskela"), a street
    musician who had performed in several countries in Europe. She checked in on December
    31, the week before she disappeared. Masakela said they slept in separate beds
    during the time they shared the hotel room and she refused to have a sexual relationship
    with him in spite of his urgings. He had a history of drug use and sexual violence
    as well as a reputation as a guru. Carrisi seemed fascinated by him. She referred
    to him as "my master" and said he had opened "completely new intellectual horizons"
    for her. Carrisi was last seen in the city''s French Quarter area on January 6,
    1994. Her parents, who last heard from her on New Years'' Day, reported her missing
    on January 18. They traveled to Louisiana shortly afterwards to assist in the
    search efforts. No evidence regarding Carrisi''s whereabouts was discovered. Most
    of her personal belongings, including her passport, backpack, clothing, camera,
    luggage and notebooks, were left behind at the hotel. Masakela showed Carrisi''s
    passport to the hotel staff after her disappearance and attempted to use her traveler''s
    checks to pay the bill from their room, but the checks were refused because they
    were unsigned, and he was evicted. He told police he did not know Carrisi''s whereabouts,
    but believed she was all right. He was arrested on January 31 after a former girlfriend
    claimed he had raped her, but released for lack of evidence after less than two
    weeks. The only other possible lead was a security guard who saw a woman jump
    into the Mississippi River near the Aquarium of the Americas at 11:30 p.m. on
    January 6, the day Carrisi was last seen. Prior to jumping, the woman was acting
    strangely and said, "I belong in the water." She swam for approximately 100 yards,
    began to struggle against the current and the wake from a passing boat, screamed
    for help, and then sank. She fit Carrisi''s general physical description and was
    wearing similar, but not identical, clothing. It has never been established that
    the person was in fact Carrisi, but many authorities in New Orleans believe it
    was her. Not everyone believes Carrisi is dead, however. No trace of her remains
    were found in the river, but it''s possible she was washed into the Gulf of Mexico
    and out to sea. Since January 1994 there have been many reported sightings of
    her in the United States, Italy and elsewhere in Europe, even more than a decade
    after her disappearance. None of the sightings have been confirmed and Carrisi
    continues to be listed as a missing person. Carrisi studied literature at King''s
    College in London and earned excellent grades before she took a break from her
    studies to travel. She played a role in an Italian film in 1983, and in 1989 she
    was the letter-turner on the television show La Ruota de Fortuna, the Italian
    version of Wheel of Fortune. As a result, she was something of a celebrity in
    her native country. She was born in rural Cellino San Marco in the region of Apulia
    in southeast Italy and comes from a performing family: her parents were popular
    entertainers in Italy in 1994, her maternal grandparents and maternal aunt were
    all film actors, and her two younger sisters have both appeared on Italian reality
    television. She also a younger brother. Carrisi''s American-born mother has since
    returned to the United States, but her father still lives in Italy. Members of
    her family are divided in their opinions to whether she is still alive. Her case
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency New Orleans Police Department 504-826-1302

## Case Details
Carrisi was touring Central America and North America when she arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1993. She had gone with her parents on a trip to the city then decided to stay after the vacation was over and her parents returned to Italy. At first she traveled to Florida, left a few days later, after telling her parents she feared two men in Florida were trying to drug and kill her. She traveled to Belize and Mexico before going back to New Orleans. Carrisi, who speaks fluent English, immersed herself in the street culture there and kept company with street musicians and homeless people.
