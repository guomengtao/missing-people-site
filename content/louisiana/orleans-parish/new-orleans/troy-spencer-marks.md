    He never arrived at his concrete job and has never been heard from again. He may

    plate frame on back, a purple Louisiana State University mirror plate on the front,
    the words "LSU Tigers" in White block lettering on back window, and Louisiana

    lot of an apartment building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was impounded and sold.
    Marks kept in regular touch with his wife and two children, in spite of his substance
    abuse problem. After his disappearance, there were rumors that he was murdered
    and his body hidden in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. His case remains unsolved.
