  disappearance_details: Guinn was last seen at Pinecrest State School, the state
    residential facility for mentally disabled individuals where he lived in Pineville,
    Louisiana, on September 24, 1993. (The facility's name has since been changed
    to Pinecrest Developmental Center.) He was last seen standing on the patio of
    his cottage, smoking his pipe, at 4:45 p.m. He was reported missing about fifteen
    minutes later after he failed to show up for dinner. He has never been heard from
    again and an extensive search of the area turned up no indication of his whereabouts.
    Guinn had been living at Pinecrest State School for almost thirty years by the
    time he went missing and had no record of absconding. His cottage was about a
    mile from the front entrance, which was unmanned at the time of his disappearance
    and was the only public access route onto the fenced grounds. He enjoys being
    around groups of people. He had relatives living in Bossier City at the time of
    his disappearance, and had also spent time in a mental health facility in New
    Orleans, Louisiana. In 1995, Guinn's mother sued Pinecrest, alleging their security
    measures were lacking and her son was inadequately supervised. The institution's
    treatment plan had said he required "constant supervision", meaning staff needed
    to keep him in sight or know where he was at all times. Five months before he
    disappeared, this was downgraded to "close supervision", meaning staff needed
    to check on him at least every fifteen minutes. Witnesses at the trial suggested
    it was unlikely Guinn ran away and theorized he was abducted from the grounds
    and murdered. A judge ruled in Guinn's mother's favor and she was awarded $300,000
    in damages. His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Pineville Police Department
