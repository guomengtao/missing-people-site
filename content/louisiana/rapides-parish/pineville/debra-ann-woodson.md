  disappearance_details: Woodson was last seen in Pineville, Louisiana on March 1,
    1986. She lived at Pine Highland Apartments in the 1800 block of Sunburst Lane,
    off Highway 28, on the east side of town. Between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., she left
    her apartment complex with a male friend in his truck. Her friend said they were
    only together for about fifteen minutes before Woodson got sick. Her friend returned
    her to her apartment complex, dropping her off at the mailbox so she could check
    the mail. Woodson never got the mail that day and never showed up for her job
    that night at the post office in Alexandria, Louisiana. She has never been heard
    from again. On March 4, Woodson's estranged husband went to her apartment and
    found it locked; their five- and seven-year-old sons were alone on the balcony.
    He called the police. When they arrived, they noted that Woodson's late model
    beige two-door Mercury Lynx was in parking lot as usual. There were no signs of
    a disturbance or foul play inside her residence. The tub was full of soapy water,
    as if she had been interrupted while taking a bath, and there were two glasses
    on the kitchen counter. About a month after she was last seen, Woodson's purse
    was found hanging on a limb in Flagon Creek along Highway 28 east, near Esler
    Regional Airport, east of Pineville; it contained her wallet, driver's license,
    credit cards and photos of her sons, but no money. Her eyeglasses were also in
    the purse and one of the lenses was broken. Woodson never picked up her last paycheck;
    her family said she liked her job, were she'd been employed for about a year,
    and wouldn't have quit without giving notice. It would also be uncharacteristic
    of her to leave without warning or abandon her children. After her disappearance,
    they spent some time living with their father and were later sent to an orphanage.
    Woodson's family believes she was murdered. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating
