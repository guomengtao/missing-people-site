  disappearance_details: White was last seen in the 1200 block of MacArthur Drive
    in Alexandria, Louisiana sometime in early 2024. She has never been heard from
    again. She was reported missing in May. White lived in the 60 block of Bohannon
    Road off Esler Field Road in Pineville, Louisiana with Philip Barry Felter at
    the time of her disappearance. A photo of Felter is posted with this case summary.
    In April 2024, Felter was arrested and charged with being a felon in possession
    of a firearm, second-degree murder, arson and unlawful disposal of human remains
    in the death of Buster Evans, whose body was found in the carport area of an uninhabited
    house on Williams Lake Road after a fire at the house was extinguished. Following
    Felter's arrest, police began treating White's disappearance as a possible homicide
    as well. In March 2025, he was charged with second-degree murder in her case.
    The indictment accuses him of having killed White at some point during the month
    of March 2024. He is awaiting trial in both murder cases. White's remains have
    not been located. Foul play is suspected in her case due to the circumstances
    involved. Investigating Agency Alexandria Police Department 318-441-6408 Source
