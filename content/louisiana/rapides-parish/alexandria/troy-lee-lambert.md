  disappearance_details: Lambert was last seen at approximately 1:00 p.m. on February
    27, 2006, at his residence in Alexandria, Virginia. He told his family he was
    going to go fishing. Lambert never returned to his home and has never been heard
    from again. His truck and boat were later located the same day at the Red River
    in Alexandria. The boat, a Bass Tacker Pro Team 165, was floating with the motor
    turned off, and did not contain any fishing equipment. In April 2006, two months
    after Lambert's disappearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Authorities
    believe he stole more than $500 from a Super 1 Foods store in Alexandria. He had
    been questioned about the theft prior to his disappearance. Investigators are
    unsure what caused Lambert to go missing, but it is possible that he staged his
    disappearance to avoid criminal prosecution. His case remains unsolved. Investigating
