  disappearance_details: Watson left her home in Newton County, Texas on August 27,
    2006 to visit friends in Tenaha, Texas, but never arrived there. She was last
    seen playing on slot machines at a truck stop in Logansport, Louisiana on August
    28. Watson's family stated she did not gamble and often spoke against gambling,
    but people at the truck stop stated she went there regularly. She won approximately
    $1,000 on the night of her disappearance. She has never been heard from again.
    At 11:00 p.m. on August 28, hours after she was last seen, Watson's White Ford
    Explorer Sport Trac was found seventy-five yards off Highway 191 north in Zwolle,
    Louisiana, between Logansport and Newton County. It had been intentionally set
    on fire and was still burning when it was located. Everything inside her vehicle
    was destroyed by the blaze. Watson's cellular phone was found under a bridge a
    few miles away, but there was no indication of her whereabouts. The month after
    Watson went missing, authorities announced they were seeking a male person of
    interest in her case. The man, who has not been publicly identified, was at the
    truck stop on the night Watson disappeared. Watson disappeared under unclear circumstances.
    Her disappearance is being investigated as a missing person rather than a crime.
