  disappearance_details: DeWitt lived with her son on Oxford Road in Mansfield, Louisiana
    in 1996. She slept on a couch in the front room. Her son last saw her at approximately
    9:00 p.m. on September 27, 1996. He discovered that the carport door was open
    at their residence at 1:00 the following morning and his mother had disappeared.
    She has never been heard from again. None of her personal belongings or identification
    was taken with her. Authorities initially believed that DeWitt walked away from
    her residence during a heavy thunderstorm on the evening of September 27. Investigators
    questioned a man who lived nearby as a potential suspect, but he was not involved
    in her disappearance. All her family members have also been ruled out as potential
    suspects. Authorities now believe that DeWitt may have opened the door to her
    home during the night she vanished and allowed unidentified assailant(s) access
    to her residence. Investigators theorize that DeWitt was possibly abducted by
    person(s) who prey on the elderly and believed she would be carrying a large amount
    of cash. Her case remains unsolved and foul play is suspected. Investigating Agency
