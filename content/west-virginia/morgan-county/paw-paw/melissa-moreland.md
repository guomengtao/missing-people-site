    of leaving home from time to time, she wasn't immediately reported missing. In
    November 1985, almost two years prior to her disappearance, Moreland was attacked

    against him in court. He was charged with sexual abuse and assault, but reached
    a plea agreement with the prosecution and pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding.
    Blair was sentenced to a year in jail; he could have faced a six- to forty-year
    prison term if convicted of the original charges. He was pardoned and released
    only four months into his sentence. Moreland disappeared several months later.
