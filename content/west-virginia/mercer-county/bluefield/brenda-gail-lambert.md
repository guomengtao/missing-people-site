  disappearance_details: Lambert was last seen at her residence off Route 7 (Windmill
    Hill Road) in Bluefield, West Virginia on July 26, 1992, her son's first birthday.
    She left the birthday party at 9:00 p.m. and has never been heard from again.
    All of her belongings were left behind at her home, including the clothing she
    was wearing when she was last seen, and her car was parked in the driveway. Lambert
    had filed a domestic violence complaint a few weeks before she vanished. On July
    10, sixteen days prior to vanishing, she called the police department and asked
    how to drop her petition. Her loved ones stated she had been choked/strangled
    on several occasions before her disappearance. On January 14, 1993, five months
    after Lambert vanished, her boyfriend, Mark Anthony Cook, also disappeared. Authorities
    believe Cook's and Lambert's disappearances are connected and that foul play may
    have been involved in both cases. They stated that one male suspect failed a polygraph,
    but he has not been charged in due to lack of evidence. Lambert was born in Williamson,
    West Virginia and has also lived in McDowell County, West Virginia. Her parents
    both died in the years following her disappearance, but her six siblings are still
    searching for her. Both Lambert's and Cook's cases remain unsolved. Investigating
