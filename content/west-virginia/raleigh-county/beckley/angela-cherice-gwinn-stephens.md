  disappearance_details: Cherice was last seen in Beckley, West Virginia on October
    1, 1993. She dropped her husband, Norman Stephens, off at his place of employment
    in the 200 block of George Street in the Industrial Park area of Beckley during
    the day. She was driving a White Dodge Daytona at the time; a photo of the car
    is posted with this case summary. Cherice has never been heard from again. Cherice's
    West Virginia driver's license expired in 1996, three years after she vanished.
    Her husband refused to take a lie detector test in her case, and filed for divorce
    a month after she disappeared. A private investigator hired by Cherice's father
    believes Norman didn't work at all on the day Cherice was last seen; the investigator
    also believes the car she was driving was sold after her disappearance. Norman
    has not been named as a suspect in his wife's case, however, and maintains that
    she simply left him. Foul play is suspected in Cherice's disappearance; it's uncharacteristic
    of her to leave without warning. Her case remains unsolved. In 2014, she was declared
    legally dead. Investigating Agency West Virginia State Police Lewisburg Station
