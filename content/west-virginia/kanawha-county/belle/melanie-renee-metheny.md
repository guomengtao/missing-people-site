  disappearance_details: Metheny was last seen at approximately 8:00 a.m. on July
    19, 2006, after dropping her three children off at the Country Kids Daycare facility
    in the vicinity of the 3000 block of east Dupont Avenue in Belle, West Virginia.
    Metheny planned to go to the Garnet Career Center, an adult education program
    she was enrolled with, to pick up her transcripts so she could register for classes
    at West Virginia State University. The last contact with her was at 9:00 a.m.,
    when she called an automobile body shop on her cellular phone to verify an upcoming
    appointment. Some person, possibly Metheny, dialed her voice mail from her cellular
    phone at 9:30 a.m. She has never been heard from again. She was reported missing
    that evening, after she failed to pick up her children from the day care facility
    as scheduled. On July 23, Metheny's gold and tan 1998 Chevrolet minivan with the
    West Virginia license plate number US8255 was located abandoned in the vicinity
    of Wyoming Street and Beuhring Avenue in Charleston, West Virginia, in an area
    known for its drug activity. The vehicle had been at that location at least since
    2:00 p.m. the day Metheny went missing; neighbors noticed it there, but did not
    connect it to her disappearance for several days. The doors were locked and the
    van was intact with CDs inside, but it had apparently been wiped clean of fingerprints.
    The only items missing were Metheny's purse and cellular phone. No evidence of
    Metheny's whereabouts was uncovered at the scene, but several items were found
    on the minivan's front seat, including a business card and a piece of paper with
    a phone number and a notation about a house for sale. On the afternoon of the
    day Metheny disappeared, a witness reported seeing a young woman struggling to
    get out of a red SUV on the west side of Charleston. The woman was yelling "What
    about my babies?" The SUV has never been located and the woman has never been
    identified. Investigators believe she could have been Metheny, however. Authorities
    got a new lead in Metheny's case in the fall of 2013, after Cindy Creathers admitted
    to helping her boyfriend, drug dealer Joey Keith Jeffrey, kidnap and torture another
    woman, Jeffrey's cousin, in December 2012. Creathers pleaded guilty to conspiracy
    to commit first-degree robbery with threat of deadly force and agreed to testify
    against Jeffrey in exchange for a sentence of one to five years in prison. She
    told the court that during the incident, Jeffrey mentioned Metheny and said, "I'm
    going to put you in the same hole I put her in." A photo of Jeffrey is posted
    with this case summary. He is considered a person of interest in Metheny's case
    and has been questioned about her disappearance, although he hasn't faced any
    charges relating to it. In 2014, he was convicted of second-degree robbery, malicious
    wounding and assault. He will not be eligible for parole for at least 24 years.
    Metheny is described as a quiet person. She used drugs socially, but was not known
    as a heavy user. She was formerly a student at Riverside High School and dreamed
    of becoming a nurse, and she was saving up money so she could rent a house. At
    the time of her disappearance, Metheny lived part time on Midland Avenue in Belle
    and part time with her boyfriend in Campbells Creek, West Virginia. Her family
    suspects foul play was involved in her case, as it is uncharacteristic of her
    to abandon her children. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Kanawha

## Case Details
Metheny was last seen at approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 19, 2006, after dropping her three children off at the Country Kids Daycare facility in the vicinity of the 3000 block of east Dupont Avenue in Belle, West Virginia.
