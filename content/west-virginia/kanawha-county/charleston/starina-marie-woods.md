  disappearance_details: Starina was last seen at her residence in Charleston, West
    Virginia on March 10, 2016. She and her husband, Arthur "Owen" Woods, had just
    moved from Mount Lookout, West Virginia to a new house on Lance Drive in Charleston.
    They had a "heated" domestic dispute at home the day she vanished, which turned
    Owen admits became violent, and she has never been heard from again. A photo of
    Owen is posted with this case summary. Owen used Starina's debit card multiple
    times after her disappearance and also sold her car. He didn't report his wife
    missing. He told a neighbor Starina had moved to Oklahoma, and told police she'd
    stolen $29,000 from his bank account and run away to Ecuador with her ex-husband.
    Starina had communicated on Facebook with a male friend, saying her relationship
    with Owen was abusive. In her Facebook conversations with the man, Starina speculated
    about taking money from Owen's bank accounts and said she wanted to go to Ecuador
    with the man. However, she had never previously left the country and she didn't
    have a passport at the time of her disappearance. The man she was communicating
    with was later interviewed by police and said he never personally met Starina
    and she stopped contacting him in March, and there is no record of a $29,000 withdrawal
    from Owen's accounts. Starina's cellular phone was never used after March 11,
    2016, but someone used her debit card to make purchases and pay bills. One of
    the things purchased was minutes for a pre-pay phone. The purchase was made on
    Owen's work computer; Owen was also photographed withdrawing money from Starina's
    account at an ATM. He continued to use the card until May 2016, after which the
    bank froze Starina's account; by this time, it had a several hundred dollar negative
    balance. Family members reported Starina missing on May 19, 2016, over two months
    after she was last seen. Investigators subsequently found a significant amount
    of blood at the couple's home, some of which was visible to the naked eye, but
    most of which was not, because someone had cleaned up. There were bloodstains
    on the front door, on the stairs and in the living room. In 2018, Owen was arrested
    for fraud in connection with the use of his wife's debit card, but the charge
    was later dismissed. In May 2019, Owen was charged with Starina's murder. He reached
    a plea agreement with the prosecution and pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter
    in November 2020. He was sentenced to three years in prison. Starina left behind
    two children, both of whom were living in Virginia at the time of her disappearance.
    Her body has never been found, but foul play is suspected in her case due to the
    circumstances involved. Investigating Agency Charleston Police Department 304-348-6480
