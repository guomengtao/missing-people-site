  disappearance_details: DeMarino was last seen at Uncle Mike’s Bar on Seventh Street
    in Parkersburg, West Virginia shortly before midnight on January 30, 2019. He
    ordered a beer, drank half of it, then got up and walked away. An employee who
    saw him leave thought he was just going to the bathroom, but he never returned
    for the rest of his drink and has never been heard from again. He was carrying
    his wallet, car keys and iPhone X at the time of his disappearance. He was driving
    his mother's car, a silver 2015 Ford Escape. Four days later, the vehicle was
    located unlocked and abandoned at Love's Truck Stop in Conneaut in northern Ohio,
    near the Pennsylvania border, a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Parkersburg.
    It was parked across two spaces, and inside it there was a phone charger, an empty
    bag of chips, and change in the cup, but no sign of DeMarino. The car had been
    there for three or four days by time it was reported. DeMarino divorced five months
    before he was last seen, and was living with his mother. He left behind two children,
    one in college and the other in high school, and it's uncharacteristic of him
    to go very long without talking to them. He has no history of getting into trouble
    with the law and there's no indication he planned to walk out of his life. He
    had purchased tickets to an upcoming basketball game and planned to attend with
    his son. Less than a year after his disappearance, DeMarino's mother died. The
    rest of his family still hopes for answers in his case. The circumstances of his
    disappearance are unclear. Investigating Agency Roane County Sheriff's Department
