    at 11:00 p.m. on February 2, 2009. She had spent the day with her ex-boyfriend,
    Jack Crone, their five-year-old daughter, and Crone's wife, and they all had had
    dinner together. Crone said he drove Jones back to her apartment, dropped her
    off in front of the building and drove away without checking to see whether she
    actually made it inside. She has never been heard from again. Jones had received
    a death benefit pension check as a result of her father's death, and it disappeared
    with her. After her disappearance, a stop payment was put on the check. No one
    ever attempted to cash or deposit it. Her family stated Jones was behaving normally
    just before she went missing. There were no indications at her home that she had
    planned her disappearance; her calendar was marked with upcoming appointments,
    and she left all her personal belongings and clothing behind. She did not own
    a vehicle. Jones is considered to be endangered because she is without her medication,
    and because of her high-risk lifestyle and extremely trusting nature. Foul play
    is suspected in her case, which remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Parkersburg
