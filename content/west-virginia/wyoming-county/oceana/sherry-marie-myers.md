  disappearance_details: Myers was last seen in Oceana, West Virginia on August 9,
    2011. Someone in a pickup truck outside Oceana Parking Lot blew the horn, and
    Myers spoke to the driver and then got into the vehicle. On August 11, she spoke
    to someone on the phone; this was the last contact with her. She has never been
    heard from again. Myers was reported missing on August 23. Three other people
    vanished in the same general vicinity as Myers during the summer of 2011. Two
    of them, Rachel Michelle Toler and Chester Stewart, have since been found deceased.
    Toler's dismembered remains were found scattered among the trees in the Stewart
    Cemetery, and Stewart's body was found weighted with cinder blocks and dumped
    in nine feet of water in a swimming pool behind an abandoned house down the road
    from the cemetery. Myers and the fourth person, Brian Cook, are still missing.
    The four of them apparently knew each other and police believe there could be
    a connection between the cases; they theorize that Myers and Cook's disappearances
    and Toler and Stewart's murders could be drug-related. The cases remain unsolved.
