  disappearance_details: Price was last seen at approximately 8:45 p.m. on May 30,
    1974, when she left her apartment on 4th Street for her place of employment, the
    Flamingo Club in Benwood, West Virginia. She was driving her boyfriend's green
    four-door early 1970s model AMC Gremlin. Price never arrived at work and has never
    been heard from again. The vehicle was found the next morning along State Route
    2 at 12th Street in McMechen, West Virginia, just north of Moundsville, West Virginia.
    Price's wallet and purse were inside the car, and her makeup was spread out over
    the front seat. Route 2 is the major north/south route along the Ohio River between
    Moundsville and Wheeling, West Virginia. Price's disappearance went unreported
    for three days, and the 1974 police investigation was cursory; officers never
    looked at her car, for example. The case was reopened in 2009. An anonymous informant
    told police that Price was shot to death with a small-caliber handgun and buried
    beneath a telephone pole. This story has not been confirmed, however. At the time
    of her disappearance, Price was going through a contentious divorce and custody
    battle for her two young children, but her ex-husband was investigated thoroughly
    and authorities couldn't find any evidence to link him to her disappearance. She
    was born in New Jersey, and moved to West Virginia after her father died when
    she was four. Since 1974 she hasn't held a job or been arrested. Her loved ones
    describe her as an outgoing, family-oriented woman who would never had abandoned
    her children. Foul play is suspected in Price's disappearance. Her case remains
    unsolved. Investigating Agency West Virginia State Police Moundsville Station
