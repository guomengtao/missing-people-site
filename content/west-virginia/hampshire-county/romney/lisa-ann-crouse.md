  disappearance_details: Crouse was last seen in Romney, West Virginia. She was supposed
    to spend the night of October 31, 1997 with her family, but never arrived there.
    On November 2, she called her family from her boyfriend David Wayne Holsomback's
    house and asked them to come get her because Holsomback was on his way home and
    when he arrived he would kill her. About an hour later, she called back and said
    everything was fine and she was going to make him some meatloaf. Her family never
    heard from her again. Holsomback stated Crouse disappeared on November 4, after
    an argument between them. She reached out to a neighbor for help after the disagreement,
    but vanished shortly afterwards. She has never been heard from again. Her family
    believes Holsomback was involved, but was told there was insufficient evidence
    to bring charges against anyone in Crouse's disappearance. Crouse attended Paw
    Paw High School. At the time of her disappearance, she worked at Zero Pak, a packaging
    and cold storage factory in Winchester, Virginia. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating
