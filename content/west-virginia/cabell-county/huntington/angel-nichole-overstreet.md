## Case Details
Angel was last seen in Huntington, West Virginia sometime in early May 2021; her date of disappearance is usually given as May 7 or May 8, but the last time anyone actually saw her was on May 1. She was in the care of her father, Shannon Patrick Overstreet, at the time. A photo of Shannon is posted with this case summary. On May 24, West Virginia's Child Protective Services (CPS), reported Angel missing. They said they'd asked Shannon his daughter's whereabouts and he said he had turned the baby over to the care of two CPS workers about two weeks earlier. CPS didn't have Angel, however, and even after checking with CPS agencies in the neighboring states of Kentucky and Ohio, they still couldn't find her. Shannon couldn't produce any evidence of the alleged custody exchange, and the agency was concerned for Angel's safety. After Huntington police launched an investigation, Shannon was arrested on unrelated charges of felony malicious wounding and a battery: he had allegedly severely beaten his own mother and dragged her by the hair across the yard. She had to be hospitalized and treated for bleeding in the brain. Shannon has a prior criminal record for multiple violent offenses, including forcibly tattooing his name on a woman.
