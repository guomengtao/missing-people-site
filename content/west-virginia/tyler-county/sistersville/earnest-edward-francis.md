  disappearance_details: Francis was last seen in Sistersville, West Virginia on May
    4, 2011. That day at 3:00 p.m., he left his mother's home with his three oldest
    children to go an appointment. He was driving his brother's Geo Tracker at the
    time. After the appointment, at 5:36 p.m., Francis called his mother's home from
    his cellular phone to ask his brother if he could drive his car to work. His brother
    consented. This was apparently the last call Francis made. He got gasoline after
    the call, and was filmed on the gas station's surveillance cameras. His estranged
    wife stated the last time she saw him, he said he was going to the nearby hydroelectric
    dam to use their bathroom. He never arrived at work and has never been heard from
    again. It wasn't unusual for Francis to work through the night, so his family
    wasn't concerned when he didn't come home and they didn't realize he was missing
    until May 6, when his boss called his mother to say he hadn't been to work and
    wasn't answering his phone. His father went looking for him and found the Geo
    Tracker parked at the dam. It was locked and Francis's cellular phone, wallet,
    money, keys, belt and the medallion from his necklace were inside it, but there
    was no sign of him at the scene. Francis is a 1993 graduate of St. Mary's High
    School. He lived with his mother on McKinley Street in Sistersville and worked
    for Rice's Construction at the time of his disappearance. He was also studying
    at online for a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Colorado Tech University.
    Francis has four children who lived with his estranged wife but visited him regularly,
    and his loved ones stated they don't think he would have abandoned them. His mother
    said he was behaving normally on the day of his disappearance. New Martinsville,
    West Virginia police are investigating his case; he is missing under unclear circumstances.
