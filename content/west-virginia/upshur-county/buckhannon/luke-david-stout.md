  disappearance_details: Stout was last seen at his residence on Hickory Flat Road
    outside Buckhannon, West Virginia between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. on July 18, 2012.
    He told his mother and brother that he loved them and would be back later that
    day. He was last seen walking down the driveway, carrying a green bicycle frame;
    he had made plans to get a ride to meet a friend and fix the bicycle. He planned
    to give the repaired bicycle to his friend, and then his friend would help Stout
    fix his own bicycle, which had damaged handlebars and had been left in Buckhannon.
    Stout has never been heard from again. A few days after his disappearance, his
    brothers found his bicycle leaning against a trailer behind a pharmacy in Buckhannon.
    It had not been repaired. Prior to his disappearance, Stout told people that Rodolfo
    Villagomez "Chino" Correa had threatened him and held a gun to his forehead. Stout
    attempted to file a report with the police about this, but he was turned away.
    Correa pleaded guilty to in 2015, in connection with the January 2012 disappearance
    and murder of Joshua Oberg. The victim's body wasn't found until July 23, 2012,
    five days after Stout's disappearance. Because Oberg was having an affair with
    Correa's wife, Correa hired two of his wife's cousins to kill him. He was sentenced
    to 40 years in prison. Stout also knew Correa's wife, and there were rumors that
    they were seeing each other at some point prior to Stout's disappearance. This
    has not been verified and Correa has not been linked to his case. It's uncharacteristic
    of Stout to leave without warning. He was very devoted to his family and was living
    with and caring for his mother, who was terminally ill. He is a skilled carpenter
    who had been practicing the trade for several years by the time of his disappearance,
    and he is also a talented artist. His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency
