  disappearance_details: Aliayah was last seen in bed in her Weston, West Virginia
    home on September 24, 2011. She had been sick with flu-like symptoms, including
    vomiting, the previous evening. When her mother, Lena Marie Lunsford, went to
    check on her at 6:30 a.m., Aliayah was in bed asleep. The child's nine-year-old
    sister also saw her around that time. The next time her mother checked, at 9:00
    a.m., she was gone. She has never been heard from again. Her mother didn't report
    her missing until 11:30 a.m., five hours after she was last seen and two and a
    half hours after Lena realized she was gone. She said that in the interim she
    drove around in her car looking for Aliayah, running out of gas at one point.
    There were no indications of forced entry to the house, and an extensive search
    of the area, including a nearby river, turned up no sign of the child. Aliayah's
    family described her as shy and said she would never have left her house or yard
    alone. Nine days following Aliayah's disappearance, her four siblings, aged between
    nine months and eleven years old, were removed from the household and placed in
    foster care. The state Department of Health and Human Resources didn't give a
    reason for the removal, but it's worth noting that all of Lena's children, including
    Aliayah, had previously spent time in foster homes or with relatives. Lena was
    pregnant with twin girls at the time Aliayah went missing, and the babies were
    taken from her after they were born. In the month following Aliayah's disappearance,
    Lena was arrested on federal charges of welfare fraud. She and her husband, Ralph
    Keith Lunsford, who is Aliayah's stepfather, both had prior criminal records for
    various charges for minor offenses. Lena's mother, who occasionally cared for
    Aliayah, died in early 2012. In February 2013, while Lena was in jail, she lost
    her parental rights to her other six children. Ralph, who is the father of five
    of the children, also had his parental rights terminated. Photographs of Lena
    and Ralph are posted with this case summary. They divorced in the wake of Aliayah's
    disappearance. The court found that all the Lunsford children had been neglected
    and some of them had irreversible tooth decay as a result. Court documents noted
    that Lena and Ralph had "vaguely accused" each other of involvement in Aliayah's
    disappearance; the court believed Lena knew more about her daughter's disappearance
    than she disclosed. Lena maintained she knows nothing about what happened to Aliayah
    and only hopes she's still alive. She was released from jail shortly after losing
    her parental rights, but later re-incarcerated for a series of probation violations
    related to her welfare fraud conviction. Lena spent the next few years in and
    out of custody; she was jailed three times in the five years after Aliayah's disappearance.
    In November 2016, over five years after Aliayah's disappearance, Lena was arrested
    in her new residence of St. Petersburg, Florida and charged with homicide by child
    abuse in her case. At Lena's trial in 2018, Ralph testified that they had taken
    bath salts the night their daughter disappeared and he didn't know what happened
    to Aliayah. Two of Aliayah's older sisters testified against their mother. The
    girls, who have since been adopted by another family, were nine and eleven years
    old when their sister disappeared. They said Lena had always treated Aliayah more
    severely than her siblings, and on September 23, she struck Aliayah in the head
    with a wooden bed slat. Aliayah's head was "squishy" and swollen after she was
    struck, and about twelve hours later her sisters found her unresponsive in bed.
    Lena attempted to revive her, but didn't call 911 or otherwise try to get help.
    She then put the child in a laundry hamper, put the hamper in the family car,
    and took it, Aliayah's sisters and her infant brother to a wooded area known as
    Vadis. This was in a rural area of the county, off a dirt road without road signs.
    The younger sister stayed in the family vehicle with the baby while the older
    sister went with Lena, who was carrying the hamper with Aliayah's body. Eventually
    Lena told the girl to stop and sit down, and left with the hamper. She came back
    without it, and they all went home. Lena told her daughters not to tell anyone
    and threatened them, saying she had brought them into the world and could take
    them out of it. They kept their secret for five years. Lena's defense argued that
    the girls were lying, and suggested Aliayah was still alive and might have been
    been sold for heroin. A restaurant manager from Louisiana testified for the defense,
    saying she thought she saw Aliayah with a man at her restaurant in November 2017.
    The defense also suggested that if Aliayah was dead, she might have died of an
    accidental overdose of flu medicine. Lena was convicted of all counts in April
    2018: murder of a child by refusal or failure to provide necessities, guilty of
    death of a child by child abuse, child abuse resulting in injury, and concealment
    of a deceased human body. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole for
    the murder, plus 40 years for the other charges, to be served consecutively. Aliayah's
    body has yet to be located; searches of the Vadis area turned up no evidence as
    to her whereabouts. Authorities believe the child's body was buried in a shallow
    grave in a ravine which floods frequently, and that no trace of it may be left
    now. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance due to the circumstances involved.

## Case Details
Aliayah was last seen in bed in her Weston, West Virginia home on September 24, 2011. She had been sick with flu-like symptoms, including vomiting, the previous evening. When her mother, Lena Marie Lunsford, went to check on her at 6:30 a.m., Aliayah was in bed asleep. The child's nine-year-old sister also saw her around that time.
