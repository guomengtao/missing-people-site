  disappearance_details: Leach left his family's Sheboygan, Wisconsin home in November
    1980 to hitchhike to his sister's home in Bend, Oregon. He was last seen at a
    dairy farm in Idaho Falls, Idaho. He had stopped at the farm and worked there
    for a couple of days before leaving. He left a backpack and some clothes behind
    at the farm. Leach has never been heard from again. The last time his family heard
    from him was on November 6, when he called his mother to wish her a happy birthday.
    Leach's relatives became concerned when he didn't arrive or contact them for Thanksgiving
    on November 27. They reported him missing on February 2, 1981. Leach had never
    gone on a long hitchhiking journey before his disappearance, but his family knew
    him as a nomadic, idealistic person. He was an honors student in high school and
    a talented pianist, and he won a $10,000 scholarship to study at Friends World
    College, a school in New York that specialized in global immersion education.
    He studied in Kenya in 1979, and when he returned to the United States he tried
    to get a job with the United Nations. His sister thought he seemed disillusioned
    following his return from Kenya. All the people at the farm have been ruled out
    as suspects in Leach's disappearance. The circumstances of his case are unclear.
