  disappearance_details: 'Vest was last seen in Idaho Falls, Idaho during the early
    morning hours of June 2, 1999. He played a weekly trivia game at the Frosty Gator
    with friends, then walked to the Golden Crown Lounge on Shoup Avenue for a nightcap.
    Vest disappeared while walking back to the residence he shared with his mother.
    It was raining that night, but he declined a taxi ride. Vest has never been heard
    from again. Vest is a toxicologist and an expert on spider, snake and plant poisons;
    he also named the hobo spider with his sister. He owned Eagle Rock Research in
    Idaho Falls in 1999, and also worked as a projectionist for Micro Moviehouse.
    He has no formal degree, but was self-taught instead. Vest often testified about
    spider bites in court and occasionally worked with the FBI and the CIA. He had
    also appeared on the Discovery Channel. His sister told authorities a company
    was interested in purchasing a hobo spider trap kit Vest invented shortly before
    he vanished. The deal was reportedly quite lucrative, but it is not known if it
    was connected to Vest''s disappearance. Vest''s family has said it is very uncharacteristic
    of him to leave without calling any of his loved ones. They suspect foul play
    was involved in his case. Vest''s relatives stated that he had not been informed
    when a man who assaulted and robbed him in 1997 was enrolled in a work release
    program shortly before he disappeared in June 1999. According to his family, the
    individual has since been arrested again and released several times on drug charges.
    The person has never been charged in connection with Vest''s case and it is not
    known if he or she was involved. Authorities stated that the individual was placed
    in a halfway house at the time of Vest''s disappearance and could not have escaped
    undetected. Several of Vest''s loved ones believe that the person was seeking
    retribution and may have harmed Vest the night he vanished. He is known for taking
    many late-night walks. Investigators said that Vest had been drinking the night
    of his disappearance. He does not hold his liquor well and may have been intoxicated
    when he was last seen. Authorities theorize he may have stumbled into the Snake
    River while walking home. Vest''s family members dispute that theory, saying that
    he was not a heavy drinker and the river was not along his usual route home. A
    witness reported seeing a body floating in the river the morning after Vest disappeared,
    but authorities were unable to locate the remains, if there were any. Investigators
    admitted that the Snake River was never thoroughly searched. Other relatives believe
    that an unidentified man seen at the bar with Vest prior to his disappearance
    was involved in his case. Authorities said that they located the individual and
    questioned him, but he is not a suspect. Authorities do not believe that Vest
    chose to leave of his own accord or committed suicide. They said that their investigation
    led through eastern Idaho and into Utah, but did not provide specific details.
    There has been speculation that Vest chose to leave of his own accord and moved
    to Mexico, but no evidence has been located to support the theory. Vest''s case
    remains unsolved. His family and friends held a memorial service for him on June
    3, 2000, the first anniversary of his disappearance, and he was declared legally
    dead in March 2004. Above: Vest''s spiderweb watch Investigating Agency Idaho
