  disappearance_details: Hoopes resided with her grandparents, Noris and Kathleen
    Burgener, in the 2700 block of east Lincoln Road in Idaho Falls, Idaho. She was
    last seen on September 14, 2001. That evening she spoke on the phone with her
    sister until 10:00 p.m. Her grandparents went to bed at 10:30; at that time, Hoopes
    was in her bedroom. Kathleen woke up at approximately 1:00 a.m. and noticed that,
    although Hoopes's television set and lights were turned on, she was not in her
    room. The back door was unlocked. Kathleen woke up Noris at this time and they
    looked for her together, but couldn't find her and called the police. She has
    never been heard from again. Hoopes's grandparents owned Burgener's Classic Truck
    and Auto Body Shop, which adjoined their residence, and Hoopes occasionally used
    the business's computer to email her friends. She used it on the night she went
    missing, and after her disappearance was discovered, the computer monitor was
    found turned on. There was no sign of Hoopes in the area, however. One of the
    shop's pickup trucks vanished from their parking lot on the night she went missing.
    The vehicle was discovered abandoned in a nearby parking lot shortly afterwards.
    The keys were in the ignition, but there was no additional evidence at the scene.
    An image of one of the shop's trucks is posted with this case summary. It's unclear
    whether any of the shop's vehicles were connected to Hoopes's disappearance. Keith
    Glenn "Mark" Hescock has been investigated for possible involvement in Hoopes's
    case, and also the disappearance of Stephanie Crane. Hescock kidnapped a fourteen-year-old
    girl from outside her home in the early morning hours of June 5, 2002. He had
    known her family. The girl was able to escape that afternoon when he went to work,
    leaving her chained to a bed in his home. When the police attempted to arrest
    him, Hescock fled in his vehicle and led them on a forty-mile high-speed chase,
    which ended at a dead-end road in the Big Hole Mountains. There he shot and killed
    a police dog, shot and wounded an officer, and then committed suicide. Hescock
    was a friend of one of Hoopes's relatives and had previously worked for at the
    Burgeners' auto shop, but he quit his job about two years before Hoopes disappeared.
    Her grandparents claim he had a vendetta against them and had threatened Noris
    shortly before Hoopes went missing, and when she vanished they immediately believed
    he was involved. The police investigated him at the time, but he had an alibi
    and the authorities didn't consider him as a serious suspect until after his death
    in 2002. Hescock's neighbor says he was hunting in Challis, Idaho the weekend
    Stephanie disappeared from that location. He also owned a yellow pickup truck
    similar to the one that may be connected to Stephanie's case. Authorities have
    not been able to link him to either disappearance, however. His only criminal
    record in Idaho had been for poaching, but he had felony convictions in other
    states. Hoopes left all of her personal belongings behind at her residence, including
    her paycheck. Her relatives described her as a socially withdrawn young woman
    who had few friends but was very close to her family, particularly her younger
    sister. She was a regular churchgoer at the time of her disappearance, and her
    hobbies included creative writing, photography, piano playing and singing. Following
    her high school graduation, Hoopes took a job as a nanny for two children. She
    was considering enrolling in culinary school. It's highly uncharacteristic of
    her to leave without warning. In 2007, in remembrance of Hoopes, September 14
    was officially designated as Idaho Falls's Missing Persons Day. Authorities believe
    that she was abducted from her home. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating
