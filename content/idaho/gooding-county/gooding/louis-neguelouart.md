  disappearance_details: Neguelouart was last seen by his boss in Gooding County,
    Idaho on January 12, 1986, his 48th birthday. He has never been heard from again.
    He had picked up his last paycheck, but by January 16, four days after his disappearance,
    his bank account was overdrawn by $56. His vehicle was discovered abandoned on
    Highway 93, 15 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada, later that month. The keys were
    inside it, along with some of Neguelouart's other belongings, and a wing window
    had been punched out. There was nothing mechanically wrong with the vehicle and
    no sign of Neguelouart at the scene. His car was impounded by authorities on January
    20. Investigators believe Neguelouart may have been taken against his will. He
    is from Spain and police haven't been able to locate any relatives to get a DNA
    sample from. His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Gooding County Sheriff's
