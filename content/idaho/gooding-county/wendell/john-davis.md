  disappearance_details: Davis was last seen in Wendell, Idaho on July 7, 2002. He
    was living at Magic Valley Manor, an assisted living facility, at the time of
    his disappearance. He had moved there in September 2001. He wandered away from
    the facility at least a dozen times before his July 2002 disappearance, and the
    administrator had suggested he be moved elsewhere, but Davis was always located
    or returned voluntarily after a short time period. After going missing on July
    7, 2002, he was never heard from again. The state of Idaho attempted to revoke
    Magic Valley Manor's license after Davis went missing, but it was allowed to remain
    open and is open still. Davis's family believes he is deceased and, in 2007, they
    had him declared legally dead. In January 2008, his two stepsons sued Northwest
    Bec-Corp, Magic Valley Manor's parent company, over his disappearance. His stepsons
    alleged the company and the facility failed to comply with state and federal regulations
    and failed to ensure Davis's safety. Davis may have traveled to California after
    his disappearance. He often claimed to be a painter. His case remains unsolved.
