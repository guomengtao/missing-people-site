  disappearance_details: Rodriguez-Hernandez was last seen in Jerome, Idaho on July
    4, 2005. He left his home for work at 8:30 a.m. He was later seen leaving his
    place of work, the Bettencourt Dairy, at 4:30 p.m., which is his normal departure
    time, but his employer stated he did not work that day. He has never been heard
    from again. At the time of his disappearance, Rodriguez-Hernandez was driving
    a two-tone blue 1987 GMC pickup truck with the Idaho license plate number 2J 13769
    and the vehicle identification number 1GTEV14K8HJ520364. It was found abandoned
    in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in Las Vegas, Nevada two weeks later. It
    had been wiped clean of fingerprints and everything, including coins Rodriguez-Hernandez
    kept in the truck cab and tools from the toolbox, was gone. He also left behind
    his paycheck, wedding ring, clothing and Chevrolet Camaro. A person told Rodriguez-Hernandez's
    stepdaughter that a man at the dairy had shot Rodriguez-Hernandez in the back
    of the head, rolled his body up in a carpet, and drove away with the body in the
    back of Rodriguez-Hernandez's own pickup truck. A death certificate has been issued
    for him; the cause of death was given as a gunshot wound to the head. He is described
    as a reliable person, and his disappearance is uncharacteristic. Although police
    are investigating his case as a possible homicide, they are also looking into
    the theory that he left the country voluntarily. His case remains unsolved. Investigating
