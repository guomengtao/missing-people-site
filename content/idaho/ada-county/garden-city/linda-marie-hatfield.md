  disappearance_details: Hatfield was last seen on May 29, 1984 in Garden City, Idaho.
    She worked her shift at the Hunt Club, and at 1:00 a.m. a bouncer escorted her
    to her maroon 1973 Ford Thunderbird and watched her drive away in the direction
    of her home in Middleton, Idaho. She has never been heard from again. Her husband
    of ten years reported her missing the next day, after he checked with their friends
    and family and no one had heard from her. Some Middleton residents reported seeing
    Hatfield's car and another car parked in the street at 2:00 a.m., an hour after
    she left the Hunt Club. They heard what they thought was a man and a woman arguing.
    At 8:30 a.m. the next day, Hatfield's car was found in a parking lot of Floor
    Specialties Inc. in the 2700 block of South Curtis Road in Boise, Idaho. She hadn't
    been reported missing yet at that time. When police later processed the vehicle
    for evidence, they noted it had scratches on the right side of the front bumper,
    consistent with contact with barbed wire, and grass and weeds stuck under the
    bumper. Inside the car was an envelope stuffed with play money, some old newspapers,
    two glasses, a can of Budweiser beer and a book titled Guide for Parents. The
    White shorts and red halter top Hatfield had been wearing the day she went missing
    were in the trunk of her car, as was her purse, but her identification, credit
    cards and money were missing. She didn't have any extra clothing at the time of
    her disappearance. In November 1984, six months after Hatfield's disappearance,
    a small clutch purse identified as hers, containing her credit cards, was found
    in the New York Canal. This was less than a mile from where her car had been found
    abandoned. The canal had recently been drained and the purse was in six inches
    of water. There was no other sign of her. Hatfield's husband stated she was working
    as a dancer and cocktail waitress at the Hunt Club because she wanted to earn
    money to finish building the family home. She is described as a reliable employee
    who had worked at the club for three years. Her co-workers stated she was in a
    good mood on the night of her disappearance, hadn't been drinking and said she
    planned to drive straight home after work. She has four children whom she was
    close to, and authorities do not believe she would have abandoned them. In 1988,
    police got a lead in Hatfield's case. A tipster told them that she had come onto
    some money before she went missing and had been robbed by several people. The
    prime suspect in the robbery was Carl Burgess, who frequently visited the Hunt
    Club. Witnesses reported that Burgess came home on the night of Hatfield's disappearance
    in a "manic" mood and in possession of a woman's set of wedding rings. Burgess
    abducted and raped a Boise woman in 1984, and was later imprisoned for this. He
    died in prison in 2001. He was never charged in Hatfield's disappearance. She
    was declared legally dead in 1987, at her husband's request. Foul play is suspected
    in her case. Investigating Agency Ada County Sheriff's Office 208-577-3000 Source
