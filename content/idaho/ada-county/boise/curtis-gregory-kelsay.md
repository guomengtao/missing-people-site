  disappearance_details: Kelsay was last seen at his home near Lakeharbor and State
    Street in Boise, Idaho on April 15, 2020. He left home without taking his wallet,
    phone or medication, although he did take a headlamp and possibly also walking
    poles. He has never been heard from again. He was driving a silver four-door 2010
    Honda Civic with the license plate number 1AJE763; it was later found abandoned
    at the Dry Creek trailhead on Bogus Basin Road. It's uncharacteristic of Kelsay
    to leave without warning. His wife stated he was stressed and anxious about the
    coronavirus pandemic at the time of his disappearance, and had not been sleeping
    well. His case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Boise Police Department
