  disappearance_details: Kyle was last seen on August 17, 2001 in Boise County, Idaho.
    He was camping in the Pine Flats area with his brother and a friend at the time.
    They used drugs that night, and the next day the police arrested Kyle's brother,
    his friend, and one of the men's wives, all of whom were still under the influence
    and hallucinating. The woman told police Kyle had run away from the campsite in
    the middle of the night, saying he was going to find a McDonald's restaurant.
    He left his wallet and $300 in cash behind. He never returned and has never been
    heard from again. Investigators initially assumed he'd hitchhiked out of the area.
    Kyle led a transient lifestyle and as a result, his family didn't file a missing
    persons report for two years. Authorities conducted a search in the Pine Flats
    area in 2013, looking for Kyle's remains, but found nothing of interest. His disappearance
    remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Boise County Sheriff's Office 208-392-4411
