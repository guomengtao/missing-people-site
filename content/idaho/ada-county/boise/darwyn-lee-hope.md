  disappearance_details: Darwyn was last seen at his home in Boise, Idaho on July
    11, 2016. He left his money and hearing aids behind at home and has never been
    heard from again. He may be driving a silver 2003 Pontiac Bonneville with the
    Idaho license plate number 1A7478F; a photo of a similar vehicle is posted with
    this case summary. He enjoys visiting McCall, Idaho and may have attempted to
    travel there. According to his sons, he suffered from extreme pain in his groin
    and couldn't have driven for longer than about thirty minutes at a time. Police
    believe Darwyn is missing under suspicious circumstances. Two of his sons, Mike
    and Dale Hope, are considered suspects in his case. They both took polygraphs;
    Dale's was inconclusive and Mike failed his. Police told them they suspected they
    had helped their father take his own life and then disposed of his body, something
    Darwyn's sons denied. They maintain their innocence in their father's disappearance;
    it remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Boise Police Department 208-570-6000
