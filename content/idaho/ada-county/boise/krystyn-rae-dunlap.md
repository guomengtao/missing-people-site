  disappearance_details: Krystyn disappeared from Boise, Idaho on October 14, 1994.
    She left a note for her family saying she had to get away but would return in
    a year's time. A friend of hers said she had wanted to travel to Oregon to get
    away from her boyfriend. She had had a troubled childhood and had run away from
    home before, but would always return home voluntarily. Prior to her October 1994
    disappearance, she had never been gone for longer than a week without getting
    in touch with a friend or relative. Krystyn is known to have taken a job at a
    hotel in McCall, Idaho after she went missing, but only for one day. Some friends
    and acquaintances reportedly had contact with her between October and mid-December
    1994, but after that they never heard from her again. Around that time she also
    stopped collecting the Social Security benefits that she'd been receiving since
    her father's death. Prior to her disappearance, Krystyn had been seeing Charles
    "Corey" Castro, who was ten years older than her. He was reportedly married, and
    physically abusive to Krystyn. He had allegedly threatened her to stop her from
    telling the police that he had assaulted her. He was one of the last people known
    to have seen Krystyn prior to her disappearance. Castro was on parole at the time
    of Krystyn's disappearance, and stated he broke off communication with her after
    his parole officer told him he couldn't see her anymore. In 1998, he was convicted
    of sexually abusing his new girlfriend's child, and was listed on the sex offender
    registry as a result. He said he was questioned about Krystyn's case in 2011 and
    passed polygraph, and he maintained his innocence in her disappearance. A photo
    of him is posted with this case summary. In January 2022, Castro was shot and
    killed by the police in Murphy, Idaho. Deputies with the Owyhee County Sheriff's
    Office were called to the address to serve him with a civil protection order,
    which required him to move out of the home he shared with his wife. According
    to the officers, when they told Castro he had to leave, he became agitated, charged
    them while holding a weapon, and refused to drop it when ordered, so they shot
    him. Krystyn's case is now considered to be an endangered missing child rather
    than a runaway. Her loved ones stated she was very close to her younger brother
    and they don't think she would have abandoned him. Authorities are searching for
    a certain vehicle that may have been involved in her case, a 1989 Z28 Camaro.
    A photo of a similar Camaro is posted with this case summary. The one authorities
    are looking for was painted gray in 1994, but could be a different color now.
    It has the VIN (vehicle identification number) 1G1FP21E3KL147418. Police have
    tracked the vehicle and it was sold and given away multiple times after 1994.
    The last known location for it was in Sun Valley, Nevada in approximately 2003.
    Foul play is possible in her case, which remains unsolved. Investigating Agency
