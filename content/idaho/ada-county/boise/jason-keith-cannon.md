  disappearance_details: Jason was last seen in on the front porch of his family's
    residence in Boise, Idaho at 2:00 p.m. on March 16, 1983. His mother was supervising
    him outside, but she went inside the house for a few minutes to get his jacket.
    When she came back outside, Jason had disappeared. He has never been heard from
    again and an extensive search of the area turned up no sign of him. Authorities
    initially thought Jason had fallen into the canal near his home. They found a
    toy bucket, which Jason's friends identified as his, west of Stilson Road near
    the Boise River, about one-third of a mile from his home. However, Jason was afraid
    of water and at the time of his disappearance his older brother was on the way
    home from school and his mother was baking brownies in the oven, meaning he had
    no reason to wander out of his yard. Investigators now believe Jason was abducted
    by a non-family member and may still be alive. His case remains unsolved. Investigating
