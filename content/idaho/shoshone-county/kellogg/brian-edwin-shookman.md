  disappearance_details: Shookman was last seen at a family reunion in Kellogg, Idaho
    on July 28, 2012. He left his cousin's house at 3:00 p.m. to drive six miles to
    his aunt's house in the Sunny Slopes area near Osburn, Idaho, but never arrived
    there. He was driving a maroon 1998 Ford Escort with the Montana license plate
    number 240997A at the time. He has never been heard from again. On September 2,
    his car was found abandoned in the Dodson Pass area. A photo of it is posted with
    this case summary. Shookman lived in Great Falls, Montana at the time of his disappearance.
    It's possible he traveled to Washington state or back to Montana. It's uncharacteristic
    of him to leave without warning or to be out to touch with his family, whom he
    was close to. His sixteen-year-old son died nine years after his disappearance,
    and Shookman is probably unaware of this. He is considered to be missing under
    suspicious circumstances and his case remains unsolved. Shookman's family believes
    he's deceased. Investigating Agency Shoshone County Sheriff's Office 208-556-1114
