  disappearance_details: Stephanie's mother gave her money for a snack and dropped
    her off at the Challis Bowling Alley in Challis, Idaho on October 11, 1993. She
    went bowling with friends, then departed at approximately 4:45 p.m.. She was last
    seen walking on Highway 93 towards Challis High School at approximately 6:00 p.m.
    that evening. The school was across the street from the bowling alley. Accounts
    differ as to whether Stephanie was going to the high school for soccer practice,
    or whether she was heading for her family's residence, about 500 yards away. By
    8:15 p.m., she hadn't arrived home and her parents notified the police. An extensive
    search covering 7,000 square miles in two counties turned up no sign of her. A
    yellow pickup truck with red pinstripes was seen in the area around the time she
    vanished, and may be connected to her disappearance. Keith Glenn "Mark" Hescock
    has been investigated for possible involvement in Stephanie's case, and also the
    disappearance of Amber Hoopes. Hescock kidnapped a fourteen-year-old girl from
    outside her home in the early morning hours of June 5, 2002. He had known her
    family. The girl was able to escape that afternoon when he went to work, leaving
    her chained to a bed in his home. When the police attempted to arrest him, Hescock
    fled in his vehicle and lead them on a forty-mile high-speed chase, which ended
    at a dead-end road in the Big Hole Mountains. There he shot and killed a police
    dog, shot and wounded an officer, and then committed suicide. Hescock had previously
    worked for Hoopes's grandparents, and his neighbor says he was hunting in Challis
    the weekend Stephanie disappeared from that location. He also owned a yellow pickup
    truck similar to the one that may be connected to Stephanie's case, and Stephanie's
    great-grandparents believe he was the "weird guy" with a yellow pickup truck who
    camped next to them when they went camping near Twin Peaks, Idaho the weekend
    before Stephanie went missing. Authorities have not been able to link Hescock
    to either Stephanie's or Hoopes's disappearance, however. His only criminal record
    in Idaho had been for poaching, but he had felony convictions in other states.
    Authorities have five to ten persons of interest in Stephanie's case, none of
    whom are family members. One of them, a woman, refused to answer any questions
    without an attorney present; another, a man, took a polygraph on the case and
    his answers were "deceptive but inconclusive." Investigators believe Stephanie
    was taken against her will by a stranger. Her case remains unsolved. She has three
    younger sisters and is described as a tomboy who was part of the youth bowling
    league and enjoyed going hunting and fishing with her father. Her parents divorced
    in mid-1994 and both of them are now deceased; her mother died in 1997 and her
    father in 2012, both of natural causes. Her sisters and many members of her extended
    family are still alive, however. Investigating Agency Custer County Sheriff's
