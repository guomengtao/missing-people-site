  disappearance_details: Pearsall was last seen at the Lewiston Civic Theater in Lewiston,
    Idaho on September 14, 1982. He was employed as a janitor there, and asked his
    friends to drop him off so he could do some laundry and practice his clarinet.
    He has never been heard from again. Pearsall is a former U.S. Air Force corporal.
    He left his clarinet behind at the theater, which is uncharacteristic of him.
    He also left his car parked at a friend's house and an uncashed paycheck at his
    apartment. He went missing on the same night as stepsisters Kristina Nelson, 21,
    and Jacqueline A. "Brandy" Miller, 18. The two women were last seen leaving Nelson's
    apartment to go to a grocery store. Both women knew Pearsall and he had a "big
    brother" type relationship with them. They lived only a few blocks from his apartment,
    and they would have passed the theater on their way to the store, and may have
    gone inside. Nelson had previously been a janitor at the theater, and when she
    quit, Pearsall replaced her. Nelson and Miller's bodies were found in a canyon
    in Kendrick, Idaho almost two years after their disappearances; their homicides
    remain unsolved. Photos of Nelson and Miller are posted with this case summary.
    Authorities believe it's possible Pearsall witnessed their murders and was himself
    killed as a result. Investigators believe Pearsall's disappearance and Nelson
    and Miller's murders are connected to the disappearance of Christina White, who
    disappeared from Asotin County, Idaho in 1979, and the murder of Kristin David,
    a University of Idaho student who disappeared in 1981 and was found murdered eight
    days later. A photo of David is posted with this case summary. Investigators have
    a person of interest in all those cases, a man who has never been publicly identified.
    He lived at the home where Christina was just before she disappeared and was one
    of the last people known to have seen her, he was active at the Lewiston Civic
    Theater, and he admitted he worked at the theater that night. He has never been
    publicly identified, but he's been interviewed many times by police. He maintains
    his innocence in the murders and disappearances. All of the cases remain unsolved.
