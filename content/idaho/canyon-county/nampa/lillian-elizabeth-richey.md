  disappearance_details: Richey was last seen at her home in the 300 block of Sherman
    Avenue in Nampa, Idaho on February 9, 1964. The night before, she had visited
    a nightclub in Garden City, Idaho with a man who was visiting Boise, Idaho from
    California. They took Richey's car home and he dropped her off sometime between
    1:30 and 2:00 a.m. on February 9, then drove away in her vehicle back to where
    he was staying in Boise. A neighbor saw lights on in Richey's kitchen; she was
    a widow and lived alone. At 11:00 a.m., Richey's friend from the previous night
    arrived at her home to return her car. He had brought another man with him; they
    had been invited to have breakfast with her. When they knocked on the door, no
    one answered. The door was open and the two men went inside, verified there was
    no one in the house, and left a note before leaving. Richey has never been heard
    from again. She was reported missing at 4:00 p.m. the next day, after she failed
    to show up for her shift at Bullock's Jewelry at noon. An extensive search of
    the area turned up no indication of her whereabouts. When they checked the house,
    police found the evening wrap she had worn to the nightclub hanging in her closet,
    but the black cocktail dress she'd worn was missing. A black evening purse, a
    green and brown plaid dress, a short White cloth coat, a large black purse with
    brass fittings and a book titled A Man Named Peter was also missing. Nothing else
    had been taken, not even toiletries, and nothing was out of place. Richey had
    planned to visit her son, who lived in Moscow, Idaho, later that month; police
    found the plane tickets she'd purchased for the visit in her house. The two men
    who went to Richey's house on the morning of February 9 were questioned closely
    by police; they cooperated fully with the investigation and were cleared as suspects.
    Authorities aren't sure what caused Richey to disappear. In 1967, one of her sons
    petitioned to have her declared legally dead. Investigating Agency Nampa Police
