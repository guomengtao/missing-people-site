  disappearance_details: Diane was last seen at her home on Delaware Avenue in Nampa,
    Idaho on the morning of March 25, 1977. The previous day, she and Fred Thomas
    Schulte Jr., her husband of two years, had gone to the library and checked out
    a book. Fred stated he asked Diane if she wanted to go for a walk afterwards,
    but she declined and said she didn't feel well, so they went home. The next morning,
    Diane still didn't feel well. Fred went to work at 7:20 a.m. When he returned,
    his wife was gone. There were no indications of a struggle or forced entry to
    the home. The car was still parked at the residence and there was mail in the
    mailbox and a UPS package on the porch. All of Diane's belongings, including her
    purse and money, were left behind at home. Diane's three cats were locked in the
    spare bedroom, which is where she normally left them whenever she went out, but
    she left her wedding ring and watch on top of a desk, which is where she kept
    them when she was at home or only going out for a few minutes. Diane has never
    been heard from again. She has no history of dropping out of sight and she is
    described her as an extremely reserved woman who had no friends in the area, didn't
    associate with the neighbors and rarely left the house. She was taking classes
    at Boise State University and enjoyed reading, macrame projects and spending time
    with her pet cats. She was estranged from her parents and the only person she
    was close to besides her husband was her grandmother, who lived in Flint, Michigan;
    they kept in touch by phone. According to the Schultes' neighbors, Diane and Fred
    were devoted to each other and had no history of domestic arguments. Diane's grandmother
    stated she was "highly upset and emotional" during their last conversation, possibly
    because her parents were coming to visit later that year. Diane didn't want to
    see them and had asked Fred to persuade them to cancel the trip. However, Fred
    stated his wife was in an "unusually good mood" just prior to her disappearance.
    On April 1, a week after Diane vanished, police asked Fred to take a polygraph
    test about his wife's disappearance and he agreed. The test was scheduled for
    the following week, but on April 3, Fred's body was found inside his wife's dark
    blue 1975 Buick. He had been driving northbound on Highway 95 at a high rate of
    speed when he shot himself in the head, and the car ran off the road and down
    an embankment. He left behind two suicide notes. The first was a will. The second
    stated Diane "gave my life meaning and purpose" and "was everything I ever wanted
    and needed in a woman," and that he had given up hope that she would return home
    alive and he couldn't live without her. Neither of the notes indicated that Fred
    knew what had happened to her. Authorities noted that the living room rug was
    missing from the Schulte residence after Diane's disappearance, and there was
    also a four-inch hole cut out of a drape; the missing rug and piece of drape were
    never located. They also found a dent in the floor which they think could have
    been caused by a bullet. They searched the Schulte home for Diane's body after
    Fred's death and dug up the couple's garden, but found nothing. Investigators
    believe Fred may have murdered his wife, but they have no hard evidence to support
    this theory. Her remains have never been found, but foul play is suspected in
    her case. Investigating Agency Nampa Police Department 208-465-2257 Source Information
