## Case Details
Curtis was last seen playing in the yard in the 300th block of 15th Avenue north in Nampa, Idaho between noon and 1:00 p.m. on November 5, 1980. His mother and an another adult were there, and both of them left, each assuming the other was watching the child. He disappeared from the yard and has never been seen again. Authorities initially believed he'd fallen into the nearby Indian Creek. They believed this because when Curtis was discovered missing, his dog who usually stayed with him was wet, and there were child-sized footprints along the creek bank. If he did fall in, however, his body was never found. His case is now classified as a non-family abduction, but little information is available as to his fate.
