  disappearance_details: Michael was last seen near his home in the area of Southwest
    9th Street and Arizona in Fruitland, Idaho on July 27, 2021. He was last seen
    sometime between 6:40 and 7:00 p.m., and his family notified police of his disappearance
    at 7:21. He has never been heard from again and extensive searches of the area
    have turned up no indication of his whereabouts. Authorities would like to identify
    and question a man seen walking through the splash pad area of Crestview Park
    around the time of Michael's disappearance. He's described as White, in his late
    twenties or early thirties, wearing black shorts, a White t-shirt with cut-off
    sleeves, dark-colored shoes and a dark-colored hat. A photo of this man is posted
    with this case summary. It should be emphasized that he is not a suspect or person
    of interest in Michael's disappearance, only a possible witness. In November 2022,
    police searched the residence of Sarah Wondra, who lived with her husband Stacey
    on Redwing Street about four minutes from Michael's home, and excavated her yard.
    Before the search was over, they arrested Sandra and charged her with felony failure
    to report a death in Michael's disappearance. Failure to report a death can be
    either a misdemeanor or a felony in Idaho. For it to be a felony, the person being
    charged must have not reported the death with the intent to prevent discovery
    of the manner of death. A photo of Sarah is posted with this case summary. Police
    stated she told them she "definitely did not kill that boy" but that "the most
    high God just told me that Stacey was the one who killed him and buried him" in
    the backyard by the shed. She later charged her story and said a man named Adrian
    had killed Michael. At her initial court hearing, Sarah was found unfit to stand
    trial. She was committed to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare for mental
    health treatment and the charges against her were dropped in April 2023. She remains
    in prison until at least 2026, on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly
    weapon and destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence unrelated to Michael's
    case. Authorities said they believe other people besides Sarah know what happened
    to him. They identified two people, Brandon Shurtliff and Adrian Lucienne, who
    may have firsthand knowledge of the crime. Both of them lived in the Wondras'
    home at the time of Michael's disappearance. Photos of Lucienne and Shurtliff
    are posted with this case summary. Neither of them are in Idaho currently; Lucienne
    is believed to be in Ohio and Shurtliff in North Dakota. Neither of them have
    come forward with any information. In October 2025, Stacey Wondra was charged
    with first-degree murder and second-degree kidnapping in Michael's case. A photo
    of him is posted with this case summary. Investigators believe Michael was initially
    buried on the Wondras' property after his death, but that his body was moved to
    another location at a later date. Michael's body has never been located, but foul
    play is suspected in his case due to the circumstances involved. Investigating
