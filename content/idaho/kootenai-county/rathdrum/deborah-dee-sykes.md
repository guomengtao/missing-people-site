  disappearance_details: Sykes was last seen in the 7100 block of west Winchester
    Street in Rathdrum, Idaho on February 13, 2005. Her husband went to the grocery
    store in the morning while she was still in bed, and when he returned, she was
    gone. She apparently took off her wedding ring and left her house on foot, leaving
    her purse and all her belongings behind. Sykes was distraught at the time she
    went missing, and she was known for drinking heavily. She doesn't have a serious
    criminal record, but at the time of her disappearance there was a warrant out
    for her arrest for writing bad checks. She was close to her family and had a reputation
    as a street-smart woman who could take care of herself. Sykes had left on her
    own in the past, but always returned within a day or two. Her family doesn't believe
    she would have left for this long without contacting her husband or children.
    Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Rathdrum Police Department 208-687-0711
