  disappearance_details: Roxann's husband, William L. Tolson, stated he last saw her
    at their home in the 700 block of east Mullan Avenue in Post Falls, Idaho on August
    14, 2005. He left to run errands and when he returned, she was gone. William did
    not report her disappearance to police until the following January, four months
    later, and only after one of Roxann's relatives became concerned about being unable
    to contact her. William stated they were having marital problems in 2005 and he
    believed she may have left of her own accord. He reportedly held a yard sale days
    after her disappearance and sold many of her possessions, including ceramic collectibles,
    jewelry boxes, and makeup. He continued collecting her Social Security checks
    and prescription medications for months, sold her vehicle, and emptied her bank
    account. A taxi driver claimed he had given Roxann a ride to the airport, but
    when police investigated his story they were unable to verify it and believe the
    man was lying. Authorities believe Roxann is missing under suspicious circumstances,
    and foul play is suspected in her case. She left behind personal belongings which
    investigators believe she would have taken if she had left voluntarily. William,
    as well as his and Roxann's son, Lawrence Ray "Larry" Tolson, were charged in
    February 2006 with filling Roxann's prescriptions without authorization while
    she was missing. The charges are unrelated to her disappearance. Both were sentenced
    to probation. Lawrence passed a polygraph about his mother's case and isn't considered
    a suspect, but William gave inconsistent statements about his wife's disappearance
    and is considered a person of interest. Lawrence described his parents' marriage
    as good, but said there had been domestic violence in the household and that he
    had had to defend his mother from his father. He stated that by 2005 the marriage
    was severely strained. He said his father never looked for Roxann, and over the
    years Lawrence had come to believe William had probably killed her, perhaps unintentionally,
    during one of their fights. The couple's neighbors reported hearing a heated argument
    at the Tolson residence during mid-August 2005. According to Lawrence, William's
    mental condition deteriorated after Roxann's disappearance; he became severely
    depressed and developed an addiction to prescription drugs. He died in 2014. A
    retired FBI agent was asked by the police to help in Roxann's case, and the agent
    came to William when he was on his deathbed, hoping he would confess, but William
    maintained his innocence until his death. Roxann's disappearance remains unsolved.
