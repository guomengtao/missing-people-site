  disappearance_details: Kristopher disappeared with his mother, Tina Rose Loesch,
    and her lesbian partner, Skye Marie Hanson. Photographs of the women are posted
    with this case summary. They were last seen together in Post Falls, Idaho on May
    16, 2001. Both of Tina's parents were murdered in the 1990s. Her father, Gary
    Loesch, was shot to death in 1995 as he was delivering newspapers. Her mother,
    Barbara Loesch, was found dead in her backyard hot tub in 1998. Barbara's death
    was originally ruled an accident, but in 2004, Bradley Steckman confessed to electrocuting
    and drowning the woman at the behest of Tina and Hanson. They allegedly wished
    to collect on Barbara's $500,000 insurance policy, of which Tina was the beneficiary.
    They promised to pay Steckman $10,000 for his role in the crime, but reneged.
    After Steckman admitted to Barbara's murder, authorities reopened the investigation
    into Gary's case. It remains unsolved, but investigators believe Tina was somehow
    involved. Gary wrote her out of his will after she told him she'd entered into
    a lesbian relationship with Hanson. At the time Kristopher disappeared, he was
    living with Steven Cassell, an acquaintance of his mother, in Spokane Valley,
    Washington. He attended Shiloh Hills Elementary School under the name of Christopher
    Robinson. He stopped attending school and dropped out of sight, and his school
    has received no requests to forward his transcripts elsewhere. He was apparently
    homeschooled by his mother and Hanson for a time in 2000 and 2001. Cassell was
    subsequently indicted on charges of illegal money transactions unrelated to Kristopher
    or Tina's disappearance. On October 10, 2008, warrants were issued for Hanson
    and Tina's arrest for Barbara's murder. In November, the television crime show
    America's Most Wanted ran a story appealing for information on Hanson, Tina and
    Kristopher's whereabouts. Less than two hours after the show aired, Tina and Hanson
    were found shot to death in a rural area northwest of Tucson, Arizona. There was
    no sign of Kristopher at the scene. The women had entered into a suicide pact
    together; Tina shot Hanson and then herself. They left behind a six-page suicide
    note; the note didn't admit to involvement in either of Tina's parents' deaths
    and blamed Steckman for killing Barbara. Due to the circumstances of his disappearance,
    there is concern for Kristopher's safety. He may be somewhere in the Tucson area.
    His case remains unsolved. Both Idaho and Arizona police are investigating. Investigating

Kristopher disappeared with his mother, Tina Rose Loesch, and her lesbian partner, Skye Marie Hanson. Photographs of the women are posted with this case summary.
