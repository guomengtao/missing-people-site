    She disappeared shortly after being released from jail and has never been heard
    from again. Her life had been troubled, and she had been in jail just prior to
    her disappearance, but her family stated she was close to them and adored her
    grandchildren. She was not reported as a missing person until 2007, when her daughter
    informed police she had not heard from Durkin in over two years. Her vehicle was
    found abandoned in Spokane, Washington and sold at auction some time after she
    went missing. There were reports that she was living as a transient in the Spokane
    area, but this was never confirmed. Authorities have checked all available databases,
    but they have not found any indication of Durkin's whereabouts since her December
    2004 disappearance. Her case remains unsolved. Investigating Agency Kootenai County
