  disappearance_details: 'Lynette was last seen in Pocatello, Idaho on May 6, 1975.
    She left Alameda Junior High School for her lunch break and never returned. That
    afternoon, she boarded a bus at Hawthorne Junior High School, bound for Fort Hall.
    She has never been heard from again. Investigators initially believed she ran
    away, perhaps to a nearby Native American reservation, but they began to suspect
    foul play as time passed and nobody saw or heard from her. Serial killer Theodore
    Robert "Ted" Bundy confessed to Lynette''s murder shortly before his 1989 execution.
    A photo of Bundy is posted with this case summary. He claimed he abducted Lynette
    and took her to a room at a Holiday Inn, where he raped her, drowned her in the
    bathtub and dumped her body in the Snake River. Bundy reportedly provided personal
    details about Lynette''s life in his confession, but authorities have not entirely
    accepted his statement. They believe Lynette''s disappearance could have been
    connected to four other cases in the late 1970s and early 1980s where Pocatello
    girls were abducted and killed, cases which Bundy could not have been responsible
    for. Lynette was the first of the girls to go missing, three months before Bundy''s
    arrest. In July 1978, 12-year-old Tina Anderson and 15-year-old Patricia Campbell
    disappeared. Their bodies were found in Oneida County, Idaho in October 1981.
    14-year-old Linda Smith disappeared in June 1981, and her body was found in May
    1982. The last murder was that of 14-year-old Cindy Bringhurst, who disappeared
    in June 1983 and was found a month later, south of Pocatello. All these cases
    remain unsolved and investigators haven''t definitively linked them, but they
    note that it would be unusual for five girls in that age group to disappear from
    a relatively small city within an eight-year span. Police are hoping that with
    new forensic technologies, they will be able to solve the murders and find Lynette''s
    body. Bundy is a suspect in many disappearances, including those of Nancy Baird,
    Ann Marie Burr, Julie Cunningham, Susan Curtis, Georgeann Hawkins, Vicki Hollar,
    Rita Jolly, Donna Manson, Denise Oliverson, Nancy Wilcox, and many other girls
    and young women. The women continue to be listed as missing persons. Their remains
    have never been recovered. Lynette was the youngest of three children, one of
    whom died before she was born. She was born in Washington and moved to Idaho in
    1967; she lived with her family on Fairbanks Street. She had a good relationship
    with her family in 1975. She was in the seventh grade, was a good student and
    was considered a normal preteen, although she did have some problems with school
    truancy. She remains listed as a missing person. Investigating Agency Pocatello

## Case Details
Lynette was last seen in Pocatello, Idaho on May 6, 1975. She left Alameda Junior High School for her lunch break and never returned. That afternoon, she boarded a bus at Hawthorne Junior High School, bound for Fort Hall. She has never been heard from again. Investigators initially believed she ran away, perhaps to a nearby Native American reservation, but they began to suspect foul play as time passed and nobody saw or heard from her.
