  disappearance_details: Chris was last seen in Kootenai County, Idaho on September
    7, 1980. He was active in the 4-H program at his school and went to the North
    Idaho State Fair that day, showing his pigs. He left to go to his family's home
    off Ramsey Road to feed his other animals. He supposedly went to a party later.

    to investigate other theories. There were rumors that Chris was racing cars with
    his friends that night, and there was an accident in which he was killed. One
    witness reported seeing a Ford Mustang, "wrecked with lots of blood inside." Police
    were never able to confirm the stories, however. His case remains unsolved and
